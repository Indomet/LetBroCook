Mix on medium speed until completely combined, about 1 minute, then add the granulated and brown sugars and salt and mix until incorporated and smooth, 1 minute more. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl. Add the vanilla and briefly mix to incorporate, then add the flour, ½ cup at a time, and mix on low speed until no pockets of flour remain.",

The recipe can easily be customized to include your favorite herb, nuts, or spices. The pink peppercorn glaze is completely optional, but it does add a fun pizazz and punch of flavor.",
        "steps": [
            "Make the rosemary shortbread: Preheat the oven to 325°F (160°C). Line an 8-inch or 9-inch square baking dish (preferably aluminum) with parchment paper. Grease with nonstick spray, if you have.",

            "Bake the shortbread for 40–45 minutes if using an 8-inch pan, or 35–40 minutes if using a 9-inch pan, until the edges are light golden brown. Remove from the oven. The dough will be a bit crumbly and unset, so let cool for 20–30 minutes.",
            "After cooling slightly, lift the whole shortbread up out of the pan using the parchment paper and set it on a cutting board. Slice into 18–24 bars with a sharp knife, then carefully lift the parchment again to transfer the bars back into the pan to cool completely, 1–2 hours. The cooled shortbread can be wrapped in plastic wrap and kept in a cool, dry place for up to 2 days.",
            "Make the pink peppercorn glaze: Using a spice grinder or a coffee grinder, grind the pink peppercorns into a fine powder.",
            "Add the ground peppercorns to a small bowl, add the powdered sugar and salt, and use a small whisk to combine. Add the milk and continue to whisk until smooth. Add a bit more powdered sugar if the glaze is too thin.",
            "Once the shortbread has cooled completely, remove the bars from the pan and set on a wire rack, spacing about 1 inch apart from one another. Place a baking sheet underneath the rack to catch any frosting drips, if desired..",
            "Transfer the pink peppercorn glaze to a piping bag, then snip off the tip. Pipe the glaze back and forth across the shortbread cookies. (You could also use a spoon here, instead of a piping bag.) Let the glaze set for at least 30 minutes before serving.",

            "In a medium saucepan, combine the sugar and water. Cover with a tight-fitting lid and set over medium heat. Cook for 4–5 minutes, or until the sugar has dissolved and the mixture is bubbling. Remove the lid and continue cooking for another 4–5 minutes, or until the sugar turns a light honey color around the edges of the pan. Gently swirl the pot until the color is homogeneous, then remove from the heat.",

            "Pour the custard mixture over the hardened caramel and skim off any remaining bubbles from the surface.",
            "Place the flan in a large roasting pan, then transfer the roasting pan to the middle oven rack. Carefully fill the roasting pan with hot water, coming halfway up the sides of the flan pan.",
            "Bake for 50–55 minutes, or until the edges of the flan are set but the center is still jiggly. Remove from the oven and leave in the water bath for 30 minutes, until the pan is cool enough to handle. Remove the flan from the water bath, cover, and transfer to the refrigerator to chill for at least 4 hours, up to overnight.",

Fresh pasta dough is rolled out with candy stripes, then turned into a variety of shapes, like bowties, tortelloni, caramelle, and ravioli, filled with a creamy cacio e pepe filling and tossed in a lemony brown butter sauce for a dish your family will love!",
        "steps": [
            "Prep the cacio e pepe filling: Add the ricotta to a strainer (or wrap in cheesecloth) and set inside (or hang over) a medium bowl. Refrigerate overnight to drain excess moisture (this step is optional, but will result in an extra creamy filling).",
            "Make the pasta dough: Add 1¼ cups plus 1 tablespoon of flour to a clean surface and make a well in the center. Add 1 whole egg, 3 egg yolks, and a pinch of salt to the well and slowly beat with a fork, gradually incorporating flour from around the edges. When the dough starts to come together, switch to your hands and knead until the dough is smooth and supple, 20–30 minutes. Alternatively, combine the ingredients in a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook and beat on low speed until smooth and pliable, about 15 minutes. Wrap the dough tightly in plastic wrap and let rest at room temperature for 2 hours.",
            "Cut the dough into thirds. With a rolling pin, roll one portion of the dough out to a ½-inch-thick rectangle and pass through a pasta maker on the widest setting 3–5 times. Alternatively, roll the pasta out by hand with a rolling pin.",
            "Fold the dough so that the short ends touch, then fold in half again where the dough edges meet. Run the pasta through the pasta maker on the widest setting 3–5 more times to make an even rectangle.",
            "Pass the dough through the pasta maker on the next widest setting once, then continue to narrow the setting, passing the dough through one time each, until you reach setting 8 or 9. Dust the pasta sheet with flour and cover with plastic wrap. Repeat with the remaining portions of pasta dough.",
            "Make the colored pasta: On a clean surface, mix together the remaining 1¼ cups plus 1 tablespoon flour and the beet powder. Make a well in the center and add the remaining egg, 3 egg yolks, and a pinch of salt. Repeat steps 2–5 to make 2 flat pasta sheets, then use the wide noodle/fettuccine setting on the pasta maker to cut the colored pasta into noodles. Dust with flour.",
            "Place a sheet of plain pasta on a floured surface, then arrange a third of the colored noodles on top in a stripe pattern. Gently press the colored noodles down with a rolling pin to adhere.",
            "Carefully run the striped pasta sheet through the pasta maker until your desired thickness is reached. Repeat with the remaining sheets.",
            "Lay out the striped pasta sheets on a floured surface and use a 2½-inch square cutter to cut out squares. Set aside.",
            "Make the cacio e pepe filling: In a food processor, combine the drained ricotta, spinach, nutmeg, Parmigiano-Reggiano, and mozzarella and blend until smooth and rich. Season with salt and pepper to taste.",
            "Assemble the ravioli: Take a square of pasta dough, striped side out, and spoon 1–2 tablespoons of the filling onto the center. Wet the outside edges with water, then fold to make a triangle, gently pressing the edges down to seal. Repeat with the remaining pasta and filling.",
            "Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over medium heat. Add the ravioli and cook until they float to the surface, 60–90 seconds, then remove with a slotted spoon.",
            "Make the brown butter sauce: In a large skillet, melt the butter over low heat. Simmer until lightly browned and aromatic, 8–10 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and add the rosemary, sage, thyme, lemon zest and juice, salt, and pepper, swirling the pan to combine.",

Mix with a spatula or with your hands until it comes together, form the sugar dough into a rectangular shape. Divide the dough into quarters, leaving one portion slightly bigger than the rest and one slightly smaller, then transfer to 4 separate small bowls. Add green food coloring to the smallest portion and mix until evenly colored. Add orange food coloring to the largest portion and mix until evenly colored. Add yellow food coloring to another portion and mix until evenly colored. Leave the remaining portion uncolored. Cover each bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate until ready to use.",

The cake is tender and buttery and with the Dominican vanilla-flavored meringue icing, you may be content to stop there, but there’s more! The pineapple jam filling in the center is the perfect complement to the sweetness of the cake and icing. Trust us, you’ll be making this more than once!",
        "steps": [
            "Make the pineapple filling: Add the pineapple, water, sugar, and vanilla to a medium pot. Bring to a gentle boil over medium heat, then reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer until all of the liquid has evaporated. Remove from the heat and let cool before using.",
            "Make the cake: Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Grease 2 8-inch round cake pans with 1 tablespoon of butter, then dust with 1 tablespoon of flour to coat evenly, shaking out the excess.",
            "Sift the remaining ½ pound of flour and the baking powder together into a medium bowl.",
            "In a large bowl, cream together the remaining ½ pound of butter and the sugar with an electric hand mixer, starting on low speed to break up the chunks of butter, then increasing to high speed, until light, fluffy, and pale yellow in color, about 4 minutes.",
            "Add the eggs, one-third at a time, and beat until each addition is well-incorporated before adding the next, about 2 minutes. Add the lime zest and vanilla and beat to combine.",
            "Pour in one-third of the orange juice and beat until well-combined, about 2 minutes, then add one-third of the flour mixture and beat to incorporate. Continue alternating additions of the remaining orange juice and flour mixture until fully incorporated. The batter should be fluffy with a smooth, even consistency.",
            "Divide the batter evenly between the prepared cake pans and smooth the tops.",
            "Bake the cakes for 30 minutes, or until a skewer inserted into the center of a cake comes out clean. Let the cakes cool to room temperature before removing from the pans.",
            "Make the suspiro: In a medium saucepan, whisk together the granulated sugar, cream of tartar, and water. Fit the pot with a candy thermometer, if you have one, then bring to a boil over medium-high heat until the temperature reaches 235°F (115°C), or until the mixture is syrupy and thick, but still light in color.",
            "Meanwhile, in a large heatproof bowl, whip the egg whites with an electric hand mixer on low speed for 30 seconds. Increase the speed to medium and continue whipping until the whites have doubled in volume and formed stiff peaks, about 3 minutes.",
            "With the mixer running on high speed, slowly pour the sugar syrup into the egg whites in a thin stream and continue whipping until very firm peaks form, about 5 minutes total.",
            "Add the vanilla and powdered sugar and mix until combined and the meringue comes to room temperature, about 5 minutes. The meringue should still have firm peaks. You should have about 5 cups of icing total; transfer about 1 cup to a piping bag fitted with a large open star tip.",
            "Trim the domed tops off of each cake to create flat surfaces for stacking.",
            "Pipe the icing around the top edge of one of the cakes, then fill the center with the pineapple filling, spreading evenly. Place the remaining cake on top, then use a rubber spatula to cover the top and sides of the cake with a thick layer of icing. Pipe more of the meringue icing on top of the cake to decorate as desired, then finish with sprinkles, if using.",
            "The cake will keep, covered, in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. Let come to room temperature before slicing and serving.",

            "Return the beef to the Instant Pot, making sure it is covered by some of the broth and onions. Secure the lid, making sure the steam valve is set to Sealing. Set to Pressure Cook on High for 1 hour. When the cooking time is up, let the pressure release naturally, about 15 minutes.",
            "Uncover the Instant Pot and transfer the beef to a cutting board, leaving the cooking liquid behind in the pot. Set the Instant Pot to Sauté and simmer the cooking liquid until reduced, about 8 minutes.",

            "Divide the pizza dough into 8 portions, then roll each out to a ¼–½-inch-thick circle. Fill each round with 4 quarter-slices of Provolone cheese and some of the shredded beef. Gather the dough around the meat and cheese, pinching the seams to seal, and roll into smooth balls.",
            "Working in batches, boil the rolls until the outside is slightly cooked, 45–60 seconds. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain, then transfer to the prepared baking sheet.",
            "In a small bowl, whisk together the egg and 1 tablespoon of water.",
            "Brush the rolls with the egg wash and sprinkle the tops with garlic powder. Place 2 Provolone strips on top of each roll to create an “X” shape.",
            "Bake the rolls for 20 minutes, or until golden brown. Remove from the oven and let cool for about 10 minutes.",

We dip ladyfingers in an orange juice and gelatin mixture and arrange them around a bowl to create a dome, which we fill with a light and refreshing mixture of mascarpone cheese, whipped cream cheese, orange zest, orange liqueur, and mandarin orange segments. Serve with whipped cream, more mandarin oranges, and a sprig of mint for  a pop of color!",
        "steps": [
            "Make the orange mascarpone cream: In a small bowl, combine the cold water and gelatin, stirring with a fork to dissolve and break up any clumps. Let the gelatin bloom for 5 minutes, until the water is mostly absorbed. Microwave for 15–20 seconds, or until the gelatin is melted.",
            "Add the cream cheese to a large bowl. Beat with an electric hand mixer on medium speed until smooth, 1–2 minutes. Add the mascarpone, granulated sugar, orange zest, lemon juice, vanilla, orange liqueur, and heavy cream and mix until light and fluffy, 3–4 minutes. Add the melted gelatin and mix until combined, about 1 minute. Add the mandarin orange slices and gently fold with a rubber spatula until evenly incorporated. Refrigerate until ready to use.",
            "Make the ladyfinger soak: Line a 2-quart bowl with enough plastic wrap to hang over the edges by at least 4 inches (10 cm) all around. Spray the plastic wrap with nonstick spray.",
            "In a medium heatproof bowl, combine the orange gelatin powder and boiling water. Whisk until the gelatin is mostly dissolved, 1–2 minutes. Add the orange juice and stir to combine.",
            "Submerge 3 ladyfingers at a time in the orange juice mixture for 30–40 seconds, until the ladyfingers absorb the mixture, but not so long that the cookies begin to dissolve. Arrange the soaked ladyfingers on the bottom and up the sides of the prepared bowl, leaving 3 ladyfingers unsoaked for the final assembly. Scoop the orange mascarpone cream over the ladyfingers in the bowl and smooth the top. Dip the remaining ladyfingers in the soaking liquid and place over the center of the cream.",
            "Fold the ladyfingers around the edges of the bowl over the cream. (If the ladyfingers are too stiff to fold over easily, use kitchen shears to trim each ladyfingers flush with the orange mascarpone cream, then lay the trimmed pieces on the cream where they would fold over).",
            "Cover the pudding with another sheet of plastic wrap. Place a small plate on top and weigh down with a can. Refrigerate for at least 6 hours, up to overnight.",
            "When ready to serve the pudding, remove the plate and the can and peel back the plastic. Place a serving platter over the bowl and quickly flip both the bowl and platter over to invert the pudding. Remove the bowl and plastic wrap.",
            "Top the pudding with whipped cream and garnish with the mandarin oranges and mint leaves. Slice and serve.",
            "Enjoy!"

            "Make the tart crust: Generously grease a 10-inch tart pan with nonstick spray.",
            "In a large nonstick skillet, melt the sugar over low heat, until dissolved, but not caramelized, about 2 minutes.  Stir in the marshmallows until completely melted. Turn off the heat.",

            "Carefully transfer the cereal mixture to the prepared tart pan. Generously grease your hands with nonstick spray, then use to spread and pat down the mixture into an even layer against the bottom and up the sides of the pan. Transfer the crust to the refrigerator to chill for about 20 minutes, or until ready to fill.",
            "Make the rainbow pastry cream: In a medium saucepan, whisk together the sugar, cornstarch, lemon zest and salt.",
            "In a large bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and milk.  Add the mixture to the saucepan, along with the butter, and bring to a boil over medium heat, whisking constantly. Let boil for 2 minutes, then remove from the heat and stir in the vanilla.",
            "Strain the pastry cream through a fine-mesh sieve into a large heatproof bowl.",
            "Divide the pastry cream evenly between 6 medium bowls, approximately ¾ cups each. Dye each bowl of pastry cream as follows: to make red, add 10 drops of red food coloring. To make orange, add 10 drops of red and 12 drops of yellow. To make yellow, add 8 drops of yellow.  To make green, add 12 drops of green.  To make blue, add 10 drops of blue. To make purple, add 10 drops of blue and 10 drops of red. Stir each bowl with a clean whisk  or small rubber spatula until evenly colored.",
            "Assemble the tart: Fill the cereal crust with the colored pastry cream in even lines, starting with red, then orange, yellow, green, blue, and purple.  Return the tart to the refrigerator to chill for at least 1 hour, or overnight.",
            "Just before serving, decorate the tart with the color-coordinating fruits: strawberries and cherries over the red cream, mango over the orange, pineapple over the yellow, kiwi over the green, blueberries over the blue, and blackberries and dragon fruit over the purple.",

Dip the mold into the batter until the batter touches the upper rim of the mold, then immediately dip the mold with the batter into the hot oil.

As the chips begin to float to the surface, quickly remove from the oil before they scorch or burn. Carefully shake off any excess oil, and then place on the lined plate. Continue frying the remaining chips.",

            "Lay a strip of nori, shiny side down, on a clean surface. Place the box of the musubi press on top. Add ⅓ cup of the seasoned rice to the box and press down with the plunger. Lay a piece of Spam on top of the rice and press down firmly. Lift the box to release the Spam and rice. Wrap the nori around the stack, using a wet finger to seal the nori.",
            "Make the California rolls: Lightly grease the inner chamber of a sushi bazooka with canola oil.",
            "Add ½ cup of the seasoned sushi rice to each half of the inner chamber and use the plunger to create a divot down the length of each side of rice. Arrange half of the crab, avocado, and cucumber in a horizontal row on one side of the rice. Carefully close the bazooka.",
            "Lay a piece of nori, shiny side down, on the sushi mat. Turn the plunger 5 times, then firmly press to release the roll onto one end of the nori. Tightly roll the nori around the rice to completely encase the roll. Transfer the roll to a cutting board. Rub a knife on a damp paper towel before slicing the roll crosswise into 6 equal pieces. Repeat with the remaining ingredients to make another roll.",
            "Assemble the board: Place the prawn crackers, musubi, and California rolls in the center of a turntable. Arrange the pan-fried dumplings, garlic edamame, scallion pancakes, dragonfruit, pineapple cakes, probiotic yogurt drinks, mochi, mujigae-tteok, Hello Panda cookies, Choco pies, Cara Cara and Mandarin oranges, and Asian pears around the edges.",

We spent hours upon hours perfecting this recipe to test different techniques, methods, and ingredients and ended up with a dish that has layers of creamy béchamel, rich tomato sauce, and mounds of mozzarella and fontina cheeses. We truly think it’s the best!",
        "steps": [
            "Make the meat sauce: In a large bowl, gently combine the ground sirloin, sausage, and prosciutto, being careful not to overmix. Shape into 5–6 large, shaggy meatballs.",
            "Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Working in batches, add the meatballs and brown on all sides, 1–2 minutes per side. Transfer to a rimmed baking sheet and repeat with the remaining meatballs.",
            "Reduce the heat to medium and add the onion. Season with salt and sauté until translucent, 5–7 minutes.",
            "Add the garlic, thyme, oregano, red pepper flakes, and fennel seeds. Sauté for 1 minute, until the garlic is fragrant.",
            "Add the tomato paste and cook, stirring frequently, until the color turns dark red, 3–4 minutes.",
            "Deglaze the pot with the red wine, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom, and cook until the liquid has almost evaporated, 1–2 minutes.",
            "Add the canned tomatoes, passata, carrot, butter, the browned meatballs, and 2 teaspoons of salt. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 1½–2 hours, until the sauce has thickened.",
            "Remove the sauce from the heat and discard the carrot, then use a potato masher to crush the meatballs into small pieces. Season the sauce with more salt to taste. If the sauce tastes too acidic, add the granulated sugar. Stir in the basil leaves and set aside.",
            "Make the béchamel sauce: Melt the butter in a large pot over medium heat. Once the butter starts to foam, add the flour. Cook, whisking constantly, for about 3 minutes, until no lumps remain but the roux has not yet browned. While whisking, slowly pour in the milk until evenly incorporated. Whisk in the salt, garlic powder, and nutmeg. Bring to a low simmer and cook, whisking often, until the sauce has thickened enough to coat the back of a spoon, 8–10 minutes. Remove the pot from the heat and stir in the Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.",
            "Assemble the lasagna: Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Grease a 9 x 13 x 3-inch baking dish with nonstick spray.",
            "Add no-boil lasagna noodles to a large baking dish or bowl. Cover with hot water and add the olive oil. Let sit for 5–10 minutes, until the noodles are a bit more pliable, but still snap when broken in half.",
            "Spread about ¾ cup of the meat sauce on the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Add a layer of lasagna noodles. Spread about 1 heaping cup of béchamel over noodles in an even layer. Top with 1 heaping cup of meat sauce, followed by ¼ cup fontina and ¼ cup grated mozzarella. Add another layer of noodles, arranging in the opposite direction as the first layer, and top with about 1 heaping cup of béchamel. Repeat to make 4 more layers, ending with a layer of lasagna noodles.",
            "Spread 1 cup of béchamel, then 1 cup of meat sauce over the noodles. Scatter the remaining ½ cup of fontina, the fresh mozzarella cheese, and grated Parmigiano-Reggiano on top. Reserve the remaining meat sauce for serving. Cover the baking dish with a sheet of foil (grease the underside with nonstick spray to prevent the cheese from sticking) and place on a rimmed baking sheet.",
            "Bake the lasagna for 30 minutes, then remove the foil and bake for another 25–30 minutes, until the cheese is melted and bubbling. Broil for 1–2 minutes, if desired, to brown the cheese. Remove from the oven and let the lasagna sit for at least 20 minutes to cool.",

They’re served up with a side of coco bread–a slightly sweetened bread made with coconut milk and coconut oil. Pro tip: try wrapping the beef patties in the coco bread for a delicious sweet and savory pairing!",
        "steps": [
            "Make the coco bread: Sift the flour into a large bowl, then add the sugar, yeast, and salt and whisk to combine.",
            "In a liquid measuring cup, whisk together the coconut milk and ¼ cup coconut oil.",
            "Gradually pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and use a wooden spoon or spatula to stir until a shaggy ball forms. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 10 minutes, until smooth. Shape the dough into a ball, tucking the ends underneath.",
            "Grease a large bowl with coconut oil, then transfer the dough ball to the bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and a kitchen towel and let rise in a warm, draft-free place until at least doubled in size, 1½–2 hours.",
            "Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and lightly grease with nonstick spray.",
            "In a small bowl, combine the remaining 2 tablespoons of coconut oil with the melted butter.",
            "Gently punch down the dough and knead for 10 minutes more, until smooth and elastic. Use a bench scraper or knife to divide the dough into 8 equal pieces, about 5 ounces each. Working with one portion of dough at a time, roll into a taut ball by cupping your hands over the dough and rolling against the counter, tucking the ends underneath. Repeat with the remaining dough.",
            "On a clean surface, use a rolling pin to roll a dough ball out to a 7-inch circle. Use a pastry brush to lightly brush the surface of the dough with the coconut oil and butter mixture, then gently fold the dough in half to make a half-circle and transfer to the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining dough. Brush the tops of the half circles with more of the butter mixture, then let rest for 15–30 minutes before baking.",
            "Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).",
            "Bake the coco bread for 15 minutes, until golden brown and puffed. Remove from the oven and immediately brush the tops with the remaining butter mixture. Let cool before serving.",
            "Make the Jamaican beef patty dough: Add the water, egg, and vinegar to a liquid measuring cup and whisk to combine.",
            "Add the flour, curry powder, sugar, and salt to the bowl of a food processor and pulse a few times to combine. Add the cubed butter and pulse 10–12 times, until broken down into pea-sized chunks.",
            "Pour the egg mixture into the flour mixture and pulse 5–7 times, until the dough comes together in a ball. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and use your hands to bring it together, then divide into 2 portions and shape into balls. Wrap each ball in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes while you make the filling. (The dough can be made ahead of time and stored in the refrigerator in an airtight container for up to 1 week.)",

            "Reduce the heat to medium-low. Add the ground beef, beef stock, bread crumbs, brown sugar, salt, and Maggi sauce and cook, breaking up the beef with a wooden spoon and stirring frequently, until the mixture is thick and most of the liquid has evaporated, 15–20 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and let the filling cool while you roll out the dough. (The filling can be made ahead of time and stored in the refrigerator in an airtight container for up to 3 days.)",
            "Assemble the patties: Preheat the oven to 375°F (190˚C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.",
            "Remove a portion of patty dough from the refrigerator. Use a bench scraper or a knife to divide the dough in half. Wrap one half in plastic wrap and return to the refrigerator. On a lightly floured surface, use a rolling pin to roll the remaining half of the dough out to a 8 x 16-inch rectangle, about ⅛ inch thick.",
            "Scoop 3 ¼-cup mounds of filling just above the horizontal midline of the dough, spacing evenly. Smooth the mounds if needed, then lightly brush the egg wash around the top half of each scoop of filling. Fold the bottom half of the dough up and over the filling, pressing around the mounds to seal and release any air (make sure none of the filling is trapped between the edges of the dough). Use a paring knife to cut between the filling mounds to separate into 3 patties, then trim the edges to about ½ inch. Transfer to a prepared baking sheet and chill in the refrigerator while you repeat with the remaining dough and filling to make 9 more patties. If desired, gather the dough scraps and repeat to make more patties.",
            "Remove the patties from the refrigerator. Use the tines of a fork to press down around the edges of each patty to seal completely. Brush the tops of the patties generously with egg wash.",
            "Bake the patties for 25–30 minutes, until golden brown around the edges and slightly crisp on the bottoms. Let cool for at least 10 minutes. Leftover patties can be cooled completely at room temperature, then stored in the refrigerator in an airtight container for up to 1 week.",
            "Serve the patties with the coco bread.",

The result was a tender, moist, and vanilla-forward cake packed with unlimited sprinkles and a light and creamy buttercream.",
        "steps": [
            "Make the cake: Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Lightly spray three 8-inch cake pans with nonstick spray. Line the bottoms with parchment paper rounds and spray again.",
            "In a large bowl, whisk together the sour cream, eggs, and egg whites until evenly combined. Add the vanilla and milk and whisk until incorporated.",
            "In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, combine the granulated sugar and salt. Sift in the cake flour, baking soda, and baking powder. Mix on low speed to incorporate.",
            "Cut the butter into tablespoon-sized pieces. With the mixer running on low speed, add the butter to the dry ingredients, one piece at a time. Continue mixing until a sandy, coarse meal forms, 3–4 minutes.",
            "With the mixer running on low speed, pour in one-quarter of the wet ingredients at a time and mix to incorporate, scraping down the sides of the bowl between each addition. Continue mixing until the batter is smooth.",
            "Remove the bowl from the stand mixer and gently fold in the sprinkles with a rubber spatula.",
            "Divide the batter evenly between the prepared cake pans, tapping the pans on the counter a couple of times to release any large air bubbles.",
            "Bake the cakes for 25–30 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into the center of a cake comes out clean. 8. Set the pans on a wire rack and let the cakes cool completely, about 1 hour. Once cooled, run an offset spatula around the edges of the pans to loosen the cakes, then invert onto the rack and remove the parchment rounds.",
            "Meanwhile, make the frosting: In a large bowl with an electric hand mixer (or in a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment), whip the butter on medium speed until creamy, about 3 minutes.",
            "With the mixer running on low speed, add the powdered sugar, about 1 cup at a time. Once incorporated, add the cream, vanilla, and salt. Increase the mixer speed to high and beat for 3 minutes, until the frosting is fluffy.",
            "Assemble the cake: Using a large serrated knife, slice a thin layer off the top of each cake to create a flat surface. Discard the scraps.",
            "Smear a bit of frosting onto an 8-inch cake round set on top of a cake stand, then place a cake layer on the round. Use a large offset spatula to spread an even layer of frosting over the cake. Place another cake layer on top and frost. Place the last cake layer, bottom-side up, on top and spread a thin layer of frosting over the top and sides of the cake to make the crumb coat. Refrigerate for 15 minutes, until the frosting is set.",
            "Generously spread a thick, even layer of frosting over the top and sides of the cake. Decorate the cake with the remaining frosting and sprinkles as desired.",
            "Slice and serve. Cake can be kept at room temperature for 2 hrs and refrigerated for 3 days.",

            "Set a mandoline slicer to ¼ inch and place over a large bowl. Carefully slice the onions on the mandoline, letting them fall into the bowl below (alternatively, use a sharp knife to cut the onions into ¼-inch-thick slices and add to the bowl). Sprinkle the salt over the onions, toss to coat, and let sit for about 5 minutes to draw out excess moisture.",
            "Add the coriander, chili powder, cumin, and turmeric to the onions and use tongs to toss until evenly coated, using your hands to break up any pieces of onions still stuck together. Let sit for 15–30 minutes, until the onions have softened.",
            "Add the green chile and cilantro and toss to combine. Add ½ cup of the chickpea flour and toss to coat the onions. Add 2 tablespoons of water and continue to toss until the water is absorbed. Repeat with another ½ cup gram flour and 2 tablespoons water. Add the remaining ½ gram flour and toss until the onions are coated in a thick, homogeneous batter. If the batter is too clumpy, add 1–2 more tablespoons of water and toss until smooth.",
            "Use your hands to grab a small clump of the onion mixture (a bit smaller than a golf ball) and very carefully drop into the hot oil (don’t compact the clump too much; the edges should be somewhat scraggly and loose). Add 1–2 more clumps, making sure not to overcrowd the pot. The oil temperature should remain between 300-325°F (150-160˚C). Fry the bhajis for 3–5 minutes, flipping once or twice as needed for even browning, until deep golden brown in color. Use a spider or slotted spoon to transfer to the wire rack to drain. Immediately sprinkle with a bit of salt. Repeat with the remaining batter, letting the oil return to temperature between batches.",

A small plastic baby is often hidden inside the cake, and the person who receives the slice with the baby is responsible for bringing next year’s cake. Once you serve it, make sure to alert your guests to the choking hazard!",
        "steps": [
            "Make the dough: In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook, combine the melted butter, milk, eggs, flour, granulated sugar, yeast, salt, lemon zest, and nutmeg. Mix on medium-low speed for 7–8 minutes, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed, until the dough is silky smooth.",
            "Shape the dough into a ball.  Grease a medium bowl with nonstick spray, transfer the dough to the bowl, and turn to coat. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place for 1 hour, until about 1½ times its original size.",
            "While the dough is rising, make the filling: In a separate medium bowl, combine the softened butter, brown sugar, cinnamon, and salt. Mix with a fork until thoroughly combined.",
            "Make the egg wash: In a small bowl, beat together the egg and milk with a fork until thoroughly combined.",
            "Assemble the king cake: Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.",
            "Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Lightly flour the top and roll out to a 10 x 22-inch rectangle. Use a pizza cutter or sharp knife to cut the rectangle lengthwise into 3 even strips.",
            "Use a small offset or silicone spatula to spread the filling evenly over half of the long side of each strip, leaving the other half of each strip uncovered. Brush the uncovered dough lightly with the egg wash. Starting from the side with the filling, roll each strip into a log and position seam-side down. Press one end of each of the logs together, then braid the logs into a single long strand. Bring the ends of the braid together to make a ring, pressing together to secure. Carefully transfer the ring to the prepared baking sheet, making sure to maintain the large opening in the center. Cover with plastic wrap and let proof in a warm place for 30-45 minutes, until the dough is pillowy to the touch.",
            "Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).",

            "Decorate the cake: Carefully flip the cake upside down and use a sharp knife to create a small slit in the bottom. Hide the plastic baby in the slit. Flip the cake right-side up.",
            "Make the glaze: In a medium bowl, whisk together the powdered sugar, 2 tablespoons milk, the lemon juice, and vanilla until smooth. Add the remaining milk as needed to create a thick, yet pourable glaze.",
            "Pour the glaze evenly over the top of the cake. While the glaze is still wet, decorate with alternating stripes of green, yellow, and purple sparkling sugar. Let the icing set for at least 30 minutes before slicing and serving.",

        "description": "If you’re looking for an authentic Creole-Cajun meal, a warm bowl of gumbo is the perfect way to taste what the cuisine has to offer. This seafood filé gumbo recipe will be in your family for generations to come. Use the scraps from chopping the onion, bell pepper, okra, and celery for the gumbo to make the seafood stock.",
        "steps": [
            "Make the seafood gumbo stock: In a heavy-bottomed 5-quart pot, heat the canola oil over medium heat. Once the oil is shimmering, add the crabs and cook until the shells turn bright orange, 2–3 minutes. Add the shrimp shells and heads and cook until the shells turn pink, 2–3 minutes more. Smash the crab and shrimp shells, similar to mashing potatoes, to release any juices.",
            "Add the bell pepper, onion, and celery scraps, green onion, parsley, thyme, garlic, bay leaves, black pepper, and water. Bring to a gentle boil, then reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer for 30–35 minutes.",
            "Strain the stock through a large fine-mesh sieve into a large bowl. You should have 12 cups. Set aside until ready to use in the gumbo (if not using immediately, the stock can be cooled, then stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for 1–3 days).",
            "Make the Creole seasoning: In a small bowl, whisk together the salt, white pepper, black pepper, cayenne, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, thyme, and oregano until well combined.",
            "Make the gumbo: Heat 6 tablespoons canola oil in a heavy-bottomed 6-quart pot over medium-high heat until faint wisps of white smoke come off the oil (if thicker, darker smoke appears, remove the pot from the heat and let cool for 3 minutes). Add the okra and fry for 2 minutes, until army-green in color. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the okra to a paper towel-lined plate to drain, leaving any remaining oil behind in the pot.",
            "Add the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil to the same pot. Heat the oil over medium-high heat until faintly smoking again (do not let it overheat, or the flour will burn). Whisk in the flour to make a roux and cook, whisking constantly, until it turns a dark cocoa brown, 5–6 minutes. (If the roux is browning too quickly, remove the pot from the heat while continuing to stir and reduce the heat to medium-low.)",
            "Reduce the heat to medium, then add the onion, bell pepper, celery, and 2 tablespoons of the Creole seasoning. Cook, stirring, for 2–3 minutes, until onions have softened. Add the garlic, bay leaves, and remaining Creole seasoning.",
            "Increase the heat to medium-high heat. While whisking or stirring constantly to prevent lumps from forming, add the seafood gumbo stock, 4 cups at a time. Add the okra, smoked sausage, crabs, thyme, and Worcestershire sauce. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and simmer uncovered for 1 hour, skimming off any foamy flour residue that rises to the surface. The gumbo should thicken and reduce by one quarter.",
            "Season the gumbo with the salt and pepper to taste, then add the shrimp. Remove the pot from the heat, cover, and let the residual heat cook the shrimp for 10 minutes.",
            "Ladle the hot gumbo into bowls. Serve with rice and garnish with parsley, green onions, and filé powder, if using.",
            "It’s important to properly cool and store leftover seafood gumbo, otherwise it will spoil. Fill a clean 2-liter bottle or plastic juice jug with water and freeze until solid. Once finished eating, place the ice bottle in the pot of gumbo and let cool, stirring occasionally to release heat. Transfer the gumbo to an airtight container and refrigerate for up to 5 days. 11. The gumbo can also be frozen for up to 3 months.",

Stir until the sugar has completely dissolved; the mixture will thin out after the sugar is added.",

Slowly add the flour mixture, 1 spoonful at a time, until completely incorporated. Add the vanilla, then increase the mixer speed to medium-high and whip until the frosting is light and fluffy. (It should hold its shape on the whisk.) If the frosting is too runny, chill the bowl for 30 minutes before whipping again. If it is too thick and chunky, let sit at room temperature for 30 minutes before whipping again. Transfer the frosting to a piping bag fitted with a large open star tip.",

        "steps": [
            "Fill a large stock pot fitted with a deep-fry thermometer with canola oil. Heat the oil over medium-high heat until the temperature reaches 350°F (180°C). Reduce the heat to medium to maintain the temperature. Set a wire rack over a baking sheet and place it nearby.",
            "Prepare the potatoes: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the potatoes and blanch for 2 minutes, then drain and transfer to a medium bowl. Let cool to room temperature, 15–20 minutes. Once cooled, sprinkle the flour over the potatoes and toss until well coated, shaking off and discarding any excess.",
            "Make the batter: In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt. In a 2-cup liquid measuring cup, whisk together 1 cup of milk and the egg until well combined. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and whisk until combined. The batter should be fairly thick; if it is too thick to whisk, add more milk, 1 tablespoon at a time. Transfer the batter to a pint glass or another tall, narrow container. Refrigerate until ready to use.",
            "Thread each hot dog half onto the pointy end of a skewer, cut-side up, pushing down to about 2 inches below the tip. Thread the mozzarella rectangles onto the skewers above the hot dogs so they are flush with the cut ends of the hot dogs and the tips of the skewers.",
            "Add the panko, floured potatoes, and rice puffs to individual plates or small trays.",
            "Working one at a time, dip a cheese and hot dog skewer into the cup with the batter, coating completely. Gently shake off any excess batter.",
            "For the original dogs: Roll a battered dog in the panko bread crumbs until well coated, using your fingers to pack on the bread crumbs as needed.",
            "For the potato dogs: Roll a battered dog in the floured potatoes, using your hands to pack on the potatoes to ensure they stick. Immediately roll the potato-coated dog in the panko bread crumbs until completely coated.",
            "For the crispy rice dogs: Roll a battered dog in rice puffs until completely coated, using your fingers to pack on the puffs as needed.",
            "Place the coated dogs in the hot oil, 2–3 at a time, and fry for 2–3 minutes, until golden brown and crispy, using tongs to turn as needed. Transfer to the wire rack and sprinkle all over with sugar (use tongs when turning; the sticks will be very hot). Repeat with the remaining corn dogs to make 4 of each kind.",
            "To serve, drizzle ketchup and mustard over the corn dogs.",

Place the bowl over a pot of gently simmering water and whisk well for 2 minutes to fully dissolve the sugar into the mixture. Remove from the heat then start to whip the egg white mixture. Using a hand mixer (or transfer to a stand mixer with the whisk attachment) whisk the egg white mixture on high for 9 - 10 minutes, or until glossy and stiff peaks form. Transfer the whipped meringue to a piping bag fitted with your choice of shaped tip. When the cupcakes have cooled, begin piping your cupcakes.

            "Make the chili: In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic, and sauté until fragrant and softened, about 6 minutes. Add the ground beef and McCormick® Original Chili Seasoning, and stir with a wooden spoon to break up the ground beef into small pieces. Add the diced tomatoes and cook for 5 minutes, or until the beef is fully cooked through. Stir in the tomato sauce and salt, and cook for another 2 minutes, until thickened slightly. Add the canned kidney beans and mix until combined.",
            "Pour the ground beef mixture into a 9x13-inch baking dish, spreading evenly. Sprinkle the cheddar cheese on top.",
            "Make the mashed potatoes: Peel and quarter the potatoes. Place in a pot and cover with cold water by 1 inch. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat and cook until the potatoes are fork-tender, 20–30 minutes. Drain the potatoes and transfer to a large bowl.",
            "Add sour cream and melted butter to the bowl with the potatoes. Using an electric hand mixer on medium-low speed, whip the potatoes until smooth. Add the half-and-half, McCormick® Garlic Powder, white pepper, and salt, and mix on low speed until combined.",
            "Spread the mashed potatoes evenly over the chili.",
            "Turn the broiler on high. Broil the shepherd’s pie for 10 minutes, or until the top is light golden brown. Serve warm.",
            "Enjoy!"

Reduce the heat to medium low and mix well with a wooden spoon until the mixture has no lumps and the flour has cooked out, about 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and allow the mixture to cool for a few minutes. Then add the vanilla extract, followed by one of the eggs. Whisk vigorously to bring the mixture together to a uniform consistency, then add the second egg and repeat. Whisk until the mixture forms a homogeneous dough, then transfer to a piping bag that is fitted with a large star tip.",

Carefully pipe 8” long ropes of the churro dough into the oil, cutting with a pair of sharp kitchen shears or simply ripping by hand. Allow the churros to fry for 2-3 minutes, flipping halfway through for even golden brown colour. When golden and cooked, take the churros out of the oil, transfer to a paper towel lined plate, then transfer once more to the bowl with the cinnamon sugar. Toss the churro around to coat in the cinnamon sugar then set aside and repeat until all of the churros have been cooked.",
            "To make the eton mess, roughly chop the cooked churros. Then, take your serving bowl and place some of the whipped cream on the bottom. Top with chopped churros, followed by the macerated pineapple and it’s juices. Repeat with more cream, churro, and pineapple. Top your last layer with a final dollop of cream and a sprinkling of cinnamon to finish. Enjoy!"

            "Make the churros: Fill a 12-inch cast iron skillet with 1½ inches of canola oil. Heat over medium heat until the temperature reaches 370°F (188°C). Line a baking sheet with 2 layers of paper towels and set a wire rack on top.",
            "Meanwhile, in a small stainless steel saucepan, combine the water, milk, 1 tablespoon sugar, the salt, butter, and vanilla bean seeds and pod. Bring to a boil over medium heat.",
            "Once boiling, remove the vanilla bean pod, then add the flour all at once. Reduce the heat to medium-low and stir with a wooden spoon until the dough comes together in a ball and no longer sticks to the pan, about 5 minutes.",

            "With the mixer running on medium speed, add the eggs, 1 at a time, and beat until  completely incorporated before adding the next, scraping down the sides and bottom of the bowl as needed. The dough should be smooth and creamy, like a thick custard.",

            "In a medium bowl, mix together the remaining ½ cup sugar and the cinnamon.",
            "Working in batches of about 4 churros at a time to avoid overcrowding the pan, pipe the dough into the hot oil in 5–6-inch lengths, using a pair of kitchen scissors to snip off the dough at the end of the piping tip. Cook, turning the churros frequently, until golden brown all over, 3–4 minutes. Transfer to the wire rack to drain for about 15 seconds, then toss in the cinnamon sugar until well coated. Transfer to a serving dish. Repeat with the remaining churros, letting the oil return to temperature between batches.",

            "Pour the crumbs into the prepared pan and press against the bottom and partially up the sides. Chill while you make the filling.",
            "In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment (or a large bowl with an electric hand mixer) beat the cream cheese, starting on medium speed and increasing to high speed, until completely smooth. Add the flour, sugar, salt, and vanilla and beat well to combine, about 2 minutes. Add the lemon zest and eggs, 1–2 at a time, beating well after each addition, about 6 minutes total. Add the heavy cream and mix until just combined. Pour the filling over the crust.",
            "Bake the cheesecake for 10 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 225°F (105°C) and bake for another 75–90 minutes, until the filling is almost set but still jiggles slightly in the center. Let cool completely at room temperature, at least 1 hour. Then, cover and refrigerate for at least 8 hours, up to overnight.",
            "Make the whipped topping: In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment (or in a large bowl with an electric hand mixer), beat the cream cheese, powdered sugar, and vanilla on medium-high speed until smooth and thick. While the mixer is running, pour in the heavy cream and continue to whip until stiff peaks form, 5–7 minutes. Transfer the whipped topping to a piping bag fitted with a large fluted piping tip.",
            "Release the springform and transfer the cheesecake to a serving platter. Pipe the whipped topping around the edges of the cheesecake, then fill the center with the strawberry filling. Refrigerate until ready to serve, up to 5 days.",

Coat each cake in white candy melts and decorate with green sugar sprinkles and a red icing garland. Consider these snack cakes Santa-approved!",
        "steps": [
            "Make the cake: Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Spray 2 9 x 13-inch rimmed baking sheets with nonstick spray and line with parchment paper.",
            "in a large bowl, use an electric hand mixer on medium speed to cream together the butter, sugar, baking powder, salt, vanilla, and almond extract until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes.",
            "With the mixer running on medium speed, add the egg yolks, 1 at a time, beating between each addition until fully incorporated.",
            "Add a third of the flour and continue mixing until just incorporated. In a small bowl, combine the milk and rum, if using. Add half of the milk mixture to the batter and mix until nearly combined. Continue alternating additions of the flour and milk, using a rubber spatula to finish bringing the batter together.",
            "Divide the batter between the prepared baking sheets, spreading evenly all the way to the edges. Bake for 10 minutes, rotating the pans halfway through, until the cakes are pale golden brown and the edges begin to pull from the sides of the pans. Remove from the oven and let cool.",
            "Meanwhile, make the filling: Fill a large pot with 1 inch of water. Set a large heat-safe bowl over the pot, making sure the bottom is not touching the water. Add the egg whites, sugar, and salt to the bowl and whisk together until homogenous. Turn the heat to medium and continue whisking until the mixture thickens. When you lift the whisk, the mixture should fall into the bowl in ribbons that hold their shape for a moment before disappearing.",
            "Remove the bowl from the heat and place on a towel on a flat surface. With an electric hand mixer on medium-high speed, whip the egg white mixture until doubled in volume, about 5 minutes. Reduce the mixer speed to medium and, with the mixer running, add the butter, a cube at a time. As you add the last piece of butter, the mixture will look broken; don’t worry! Continue mixing until the mixture smooths out again, about 1 minute. Add the vanilla and almond extract and mix until just incorporated.",
            "Assemble the cakes: Invert a cake onto a cutting board with a piece of parchment on top and peel away the parchment from the bottom of the cake. Carefully flip the cake over so the flat side is on the bottom again. Spread the filling evenly over the cake, then invert the remaining cake on top of the filling. Peel off the parchment from the top of the cake. Transfer the cutting board with the cake to the freezer and freeze until the cake is hardened, but not completely frozen, about 1 hour.",
            "Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.",
            "Remove the cake from the freezer. Use the Christmas tree-shaped cookie cutter to cut out 8 cakes and place on the prepared baking sheet. Discard (or snack on) the cake scraps. Chill the cakes in the refrigerator while you prepare the decorations.",
            "Add the candy melts to a microwave-safe bowl and microwave according to the package instructions until melted.",
            "Dip each cake in the melted candy, using a fork to flip until completely coated. Carefully lift the cake out of the candy and gently scrape the bottom across the side of the bowl to remove any excess. Return the coated cake to the baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining cakes.",
            "Sprinkle the cakes lightly with the green sanding sugar, and then decorate with the red cookie icing. Refrigerate until the candy shell hardens, about 5 minutes.",
            "Enjoy!"

        "description": "Babka is a Jewish yeasted cake that originated in eastern Europe. The dough is twisted with a chocolate, cinnamon, nut, or fruit filling into a beautiful braid. It has become one of the most popular desserts in the US and the rest of the world over the last two decades, with many filling and topping variations. This version from Chef Shimi Aaron features a chocolate hazelnut filling and a colorful garnish of orange peel, dried rose petals, and chopped pistachios.",
        "steps": [
            "Make the dough: Add the flour, yeast, sugar, and salt to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment and mix on low speed. With the mixer running, add the water, vanilla, egg, and vegetable oil. Increase the mixer speed to medium and continue mixing until the dough is smooth and pulls away cleanly from the sides of the bowl, 7–10 minutes. If the dough is too dry, add more water, about 1 tablespoon at a time, if necessary. If it is too wet, add more flour, 1 tablespoon at a time.",
            "Transfer the dough to a clean surface and knead by hand until the dough is completely smooth, elastic, and shiny, 2–3 minutes. Shape into a ball. Grease a large bowl with vegetable oil spray, then transfer the dough to the bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let rise in a warm place for 45–60 minutes, until doubled in size.",
            "Make the filling: Preheat the oven to 300°F (150°C).  Line a small baking sheet with parchment paper.",
            "Spread the hazelnuts in an even layer on the prepared baking sheet. Roast for about 8 minutes, until golden brown and fragrant. Let cool for 5 minutes then transfer the hazelnuts to a food processor and process until finely chopped, but still with some texture.",
            "Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the dark chocolate and cook, whisking frequently, until melted and evenly combined. Whisk in the cocoa powder and powdered sugar until completely smooth. The ganache should be spreadable.",
            "Make the syrup: Use a paring knife to remove the peel from the orange, then thinly slice the peel.",
            "Bring the water to a boil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the sugar and stir until dissolved, about 3 minutes. Add the cinnamon and star anise and continue cooking for about 1 minute, then add the orange peel and stir to combine. Reduce the heat to low and cook for 20–25 minutes, until the syrup thickens and the orange peel is tender. Remove the pot from the heat and cover to keep warm.",
            "Assemble the babka: Punch down the dough, then transfer to a clean surface and slice in half. On a lightly floured surface, roll out one portion of dough into a 21 x 15-inch  (53 x 30-cm) rectangle.",
            "Using a silicone spatula, spread half of the chocolate ganache evenly over the dough, all the way to the edges. Sprinkle half of the ground hazelnuts on top. Starting from a long end, roll the dough up into a tight log. Repeat with the remaining dough, then let the logs rest for 15 minutes.",
            "Preheat the oven to 365°F (185°C). Line 2 9-inch round cake pans with parchment paper.",
            "Using a serrated knife, slice a log in half lengthwise. Cross one side of the log over the other in an X shape with the cut sides facing up. Starting from the center, braid the two halves together to the bottom and top. You can leave as is, or bring the ends together to form a wreath. Transfer to a prepared pan. Repeat with the remaining babka.",

        "steps": [
            "Preheat the oven to 300°F (150°C).",
            "Add the mushrooms to the bowl of a food processor and pulse until finely diced, but not blended into a paste. Spread the mushrooms on a baking sheet in an even layer and transfer to the oven. Cook, stirring every 15 minutes, until the mushrooms have released their moisture and are dried out, about 45 minutes total.",
            "Meanwhile, truss the tenderloin: Measure a piece of butcher’s twine 6 times the length of the tenderloin. Wrap the twine around one end of the loin and tie a knot to secure the string. Make a loop around your hand with the string and place over the loin about 1 inch down from the first knot. Continue looping the twine in 1-inch intervals until you reach the end, then tie the twine in a knot to secure (this helps the tenderloin hold its shape). Generously season the beef tenderloin with salt and black pepper.",
            "Heat the vegetable oil in a large cast iron skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Place the seasoned tenderloin in the pan and sear quickly on all sides to lock in moisture, about 1 minute per side. Do not overcook; it’s fine if the meat does not have a golden brown crust.",
            "Remove the pan from the heat and transfer the seared tenderloin to a small plate or baking sheet. Cut off the twine, then brush the tenderloin with the mustard to cover completely. Transfer to the refrigerator to cool, about 1 hour.",
            "Return the pan to medium-low heat. Add the butter, shallots, and garlic and cook until the shallots have caramelized, about 5 minutes, stirring with a wooden spoon or heat-safe spatula to prevent from burning.",
            "Deglaze the pan with the cognac, stirring to scrape up any browned bits from the bottom. Continue cooking until the alcohol has evaporated and the pan is mostly dry, about 1 minute. Add the dehydrated mushrooms and stir to incorporate. Season with salt to taste. Transfer the duxelles to a bowl and cover with plastic wrap, pressing directly against the surface. Transfer to the refrigerator to cool completely, about 45 minutes.",
            "On a large sheet of plastic wrap, arrange the prosciutto in a large rectangle wide enough to cover the tenderloin, layering evenly. Spread the mushroom mixture evenly across the prosciutto, leaving a 1-inch border around the edges, and press down in a flat layer.",
            "Place the tenderloin at the bottom of the mushroom mixture and use the plastic wrap to help roll the prosciutto and mushrooms around the tenderloin. The prosciutto should tightly and completely cover the tenderloin. Hold the ends of the plastic wrap and roll the log to help create a tight seal. Refrigerate the roll until chilled all the way through, about 1 hour.",
            "Place a sheet of puff pastry on a lightly floured surface and roll out with a lightly floured rolling pin until the pastry sheet is large enough to cover the log.",
            "Brush the top third of the puff pastry with beaten egg. Unwrap the log and place on the bottom third of the pastry, then roll up into a tight log, turning so the seal is at the bottom. Fold in the sides of the pastry and press under the log. Set the log on a large sheet of plastic wrap and roll to wrap tightly. Refrigerate again while the oven preheats.",
            "Preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.",
            "Unwrap the log and set on the prepared baking sheet. Brush the log all over with beaten egg, then use a paring knife to create a decorative pattern on the puff pastry. Alternatively, cut the second sheet of puff pastry into long strips and create a lattice over the Wellington, and/or cut out autumnal shapes and press them onto the log. Brush the log with more beaten egg.",
            "Bake the Wellington until the puff pastry is a deep golden brown, 30–40 minutes. If the pastry is getting too dark before the beef is finished cooking, cover loosely with foil and continue cooking. The internal temperature of the beef should reach 125°F (52°C) for a medium-rare finish.",
            "Remove the Wellington from the oven and let rest for 1 hour. The internal temperature will continue to rise to 135°F (57°C).",
            "Slice the beef Wellington into 1-inch pieces and serve.",

In a non-traditional twist, this holiday side is served with a smoky, salty, buttery spread made from charred poblano peppers and salty Cotija cheese.",

Roast the peppers, using tongs to rotate every 10 minutes, until the peppers are well-charred and browned all over, about 30 minutes total. Immediately transfer the poblanos to a medium bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let the peppers steam for 10–15 minutes to loosen the skins.",

Place the pepper flesh into a separate bowl and repeat with the remaining peppers. Do not rinse the peppers to remove the seeds or skin; it will wash away that charred flavor. Let the peppers cool.",

Season with more salt and lime juice to taste if needed, then transfer to an airtight container and cover. Set aside at room temperature if using the same day, or refrigerate for up to 2 weeks.",
            "Make the pepita pan de elote: Reduce the oven temperature 350˚F (180˚C). Line an 8-inch round cake pan with parchment paper and grease with nonstick spray.",

        "steps": [
            "Make the pie dough: In a large bowl, combine the flour, sugar, and salt. Add the butter cubes and toss to coat. Use a bench scraper to cut the butter into the flour until the butter is broken down to lima bean-sized cubes.",
            "In a small bowl or liquid measuring cup, stir together the vodka, water, and ice.",
            "Sprinkle ¼ cup of the liquid over the flour mixture and use a bench scraper or your hands to incorporate until the dough begins to come together. Sprinkle in ¼ cup more liquid and continue mixing. If the dough isn’t coming together, sprinkle the dry bits with more small drops of the liquid as necessary; the dough will look shaggy. Fold the dough over itself to bring it together until all of the flour is incorporated. Discard the remaining liquid.",
            "Turn the dough onto a clean surface and use the bench scraper to divide it into 2 equal pieces. Shape each piece into a flat disc and wrap in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, but preferably overnight, before rolling out.",
            "Make the caramel: In a small saucepan, combine the water and sugar and cook over medium heat, without stirring, until golden brown in color, about 10 minutes.",
            "Remove the pot from the heat, add the butter, and whisk to combine. Return the pot to the heat and pour in the cream (be careful; the mixture will bubble). Whisk well to combine, then remove the pot from the heat and set aside to cool.",
            "Make the apple filling: Peel the apples and cut in half, then remove the cores and cut the halves into quarters. Transfer to a large bowl and add the lemon juice and Angostura bitters. Toss to coat the apples.",
            "In a small bowl, mix together the sugar, arrowroot, cinnamon, allspice, and nutmeg. Sprinkle the dry ingredients over the apples and use your hands to toss until evenly coated.",
            "Assemble the pie: Dust a clean surface and a rolling pin with flour. Place a chilled disc of pie dough on the surface and lightly dust with flour. Roll out the dough, starting from the center and lightly pressing down with the rolling pin to flatten slightly. Rotate the dough 90° and repeat, pressing down so it’s evenly flattened all around, about ⅛ inch thick, then roll outward to make a circle. Continue rolling and rotating until the dough is about 2–3 inches larger in diameter than the pie dish.",
            "Drape the dough gently into the pie dish, being careful not to stretch it.",
            "Pour about ½ cup of the caramel sauce into the pie shell, then top with the apple filling, avoiding gaps. Mound the apples slightly in the middle of the pie.",
            "Roll out the remaining disc of pie dough. Using a pizza cutter or sharp knife, cut the dough into 8 strips of equal width. Assemble the lattice on top of the pie and press the edges of the top and bottom crusts together, then trim and crimp the edges as desired.",
            "Brush any exposed dough with egg wash and sprinkle with raw sugar. Freeze for 1 hour.",
            "Preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C).",
            "Place the pie on a rimmed baking sheet. Bake for 15 minutes, then reduce the oven temperature to 350°F (180°C) and continue baking for 60 minutes more, until the apples are tender and the crust is golden brown.",
            "Let the pie cool for at least 1 hour before slicing and serving.",
            "Enjoy!"

            "Using the end of a wooden spoon, poke about 16 holes in the cake, spacing evenly. Pour the filling over the warm cake and let it settle and absorb, shaking the baking dish as needed to encourage the filling to seep down. Let the cake cool completely, about 1 hour. (It is okay if some of the filling remains on top of the cake, it will create a layer between the cake and frosting.)",
            "While the cake cools, make the frosting: in a medium pot, gently melt 10 tablespoons of butter over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the milk solids separate from the fat and sink to the bottom of the pot, 4–5 minutes. Once the milk solids begin to brown and smell nutty, swirl the pan a few times to distribute the heat and prevent burning. Remove the pot from the heat and strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a large bowl. Let cool completely, but not to the point of hardening, about 40 minutes. If the brown butter does harden, microwave in 10-second intervals until just softened, but not warmed.",
            "Add the remaining ¾ cup butter to the bowl with the cooled brown butter and use a hand mixer on medium speed to whip until light and fluffy, 1–2 minutes. Sift in the powdered sugar, 1 cup at a time, mixing well after each addition. Add the heavy cream, vanilla, and slt and whip until incorporated and the frosting is light and fluffy.",

Fill in any gaps in the Brussels sprouts with thyme and rosemary sprigs to resemble tall grass. Layer the delicata squash rings and apple slices over the chard, with some falling from the tree, to resemble fall foliage.

Reduce the heat to medium and cook for 20–25 minutes, until slightly thickened. Strain the raspberry mixture through a fine-mesh sieve into a medium bowl, discarding the seeds. Cover and set aside to cool at room temperature or in the refrigerator.",

Scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula and beat again for 1–2 minutes, until fully incorporated. Add the eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Reduce the mixer speed to low and add the buttermilk and vanilla.",

Continue alternating additions of flour and sour cream, scraping down the sides of the bowl between each addition. Beat on medium speed after all of the flour is incorporated for about 1 minute, until the batter is well combined.",
            "Transfer a third of the batter to a medium bowl and add the cooled raspberry purée, folding to incorporate. Add the pink food coloring, if using.",

Scoop the remaining plain batter on top of the raspberry layer and smooth evenly. Using a skewer or knife, swirl the batters together.",
            "Bake the cake for 75–85 minutes, or until a cake tester inserted to the center comes out clean. Let the cake cool in the pan for 20 minutes, then invert onto a plate and unmold from the pan. Let cool completely on a wire rack, about 1 hour.",
            "While the cake is cooling, make the cream cheese icing: In a large bowl, combine the cream cheese and butter. Whip with an electric hand mixer until smooth, 1–2 minutes. Add the powdered sugar and whip on medium-low speed until incorporated, scraping down the sides of the bowl as necessary. Add the vanilla, salt, and heavy cream, as needed, and whip until the icing is smooth and thick, yet pourable.",

Set a wire rack on top of a baking sheet. Preheat the oven to 250°F (120°C).",

            "Sift 2 tablespoons of cocoa powder into one bowl and whisk until combined. Add the red food coloring to the remaining bowl, then sift in the remaining ½ tablespoon of cocoa powder and whisk until combined. Using a funnel, transfer each batter to a squeeze bottle.",
            "Make the chocolate sauce: Add the chocolate to a medium heat-proof bowl.",
            "Microwave the cream on high power for 2 minutes, until just starting to bubble.",
            "Pour the hot cream over the chocolate and let sit for 2 minutes. Add the black food coloring and sift in the dark cocoa powder, then stir until melted and smooth. Cover with plastic wrap, pressing directly against the surface to prevent a skin from forming, and let sit at room temperature until ready to use. Microwave in 10-seconds intervals if needed to loosen before using.",
            "Fry the funnel cakes: Working with one batter at a time, squeeze the batter into the hot oil in a squiggly circle motion to make a 4-inch round funnel cake. Squeeze in 1–2 more funnel cakes; do not overcrowd the pot. Fry for 1–2 minutes on each side, until slightly darker in color, then use a spider to transfer from the oil to the wire rack. Transfer to the oven to keep warm while you fry the remaining funnel cakes.",
            "When ready to serve, spread the crushed chocolate sandwich cookies on a serving platter. Place the gummy worms around the edges of the platter, nestling into the crushed cookies. Set the funnel cakes on top of the cookie crumbs. Dust the red funnel cakes with ¼ cup powdered sugar, then drizzle with the chocolate sauce using a spoon or squeeze bottle.",
            "In a medium microwave-safe bowl, microwave the marshmallows for 12–15 seconds, until nearly doubled in size. Using gloved hands, pick up the melted marshmallows and stretch them over each black funnel cake to create a “web”.",

        "description": "This is Tasty’s version of the ultimate chicken pot pie. A creamy chicken gravy made with aromatics and vegetables is baked between two extra-crispy layers of homemade pie crust made with premium butter. We believe the key to amazing pot pie is to make everything from scratch. Yes, that means roasting your own chicken and making your own chicken stock and pie dough. Trust us, this is worth the work.",
        "steps": [
            "Roast the chicken: Preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C).",
            "Pat the chicken dry with paper towels, including inside the cavity, then season the cavity with 1 tablespoon kosher salt.",
            "In a small bowl, mix together the butter, garlic powder, pepper, thyme, lemon zest and 2 teaspoons of kosher salt until well combined. Rub the butter mixture all over the outside of the chicken, including under the skin, making sure to rub the thighs and legs as well as the breast.",
            "Add the lemon quarters, onion, and garlic to the cavity of the chicken.",
            "To truss the chicken, use a piece of butcher’s twine to tie the legs together so the bird holds a nice shape. Tuck the wingtips underneath the breasts so that they fit snugly. Transfer the chicken, breast-side up, to a roasting rack set inside a roasting pan.",
            "Roast the chicken for 60–80 minutes, or until a meat thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the chicken thigh reaches 165°F (75°C). Remove the chicken from the oven and let rest at room temperature for 20 minutes.",
            "Transfer the chicken to a large cutting board, reserving the juices in the roasting pan. Use a sharp knife to cut the legs and breasts away from the chicken carcass. Remove the skin from the chicken and transfer to the bowl of an Instant Pot, then pull the meat from the bones and shred into ½-inch pieces. Add the bones and carcass to the bowl with the skin. Transfer 4 cups of chicken to an airtight container for the pot pie filling and refrigerate until ready to use. Save any remaining chicken in a separate airtight container for another use; it will keep in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.",
            "Make the chicken stock: Add the onion, garlic, carrot, celery, peppercorns, thyme, parsley, and bay leaf to the Instant Pot bowl with the chicken skin, bones, and carcass. Pour in enough water to cover the chicken by 1 inch, then add the reserved chicken juices.",
            "Put the lid on the Instant Pot and set to pressure cook on high for 45 minutes. Once the timer goes off, turn the Instant Pot to quick release. Strain the chicken stock into a large bowl and discard the solids. Set aside 3 cups of stock at room temperature for the pot pie filling. Transfer the remaining chicken stock to an airtight container and save for another use; it will keep for up to 5 days in the refrigerator or up to 6 months in the freezer.",
            "Make the pie dough: In a large bowl, whisk together the flour and kosher salt. Add the butter and toss to coat each cube in the flour, then smash each piece of butter with your fingertips into lima bean-sized pieces. It’s okay if some pieces are larger than others.",
            "Add the ice, water, and vodka to a small bowl and stir to combine. Add 1–2 tablespoons at a time to the flour mixture and toss with a rubber spatula until the dough holds together when pressed between your hands. You may not need all of the liquid. The dough should not be very tacky or sticky.",
            "Turn the dough onto a clean surface and use a bench scraper to gently bring it together into a rectangle. Fold the dough into thirds, like a business letter. Turn the dough 90°, then flatten and fold into thirds again. Repeat until all of the bits of dough have been incorporated and it just comes together in a smooth, cohesive mass. Do not overwork. Divide the dough in half and wrap each portion tightly in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour, up to 3 days.",
            "Make the filling: Melt the butter in a large pot over medium-low heat. Add onion, carrots, potatoes, and thyme and season with 1 teaspoon kosher salt. Cook until the onion starts to soften, about 5 minutes.",
            "Add the flour and cook, stirring constantly, until no lumps remain and the flour is evenly incorporated into the butter, 2–3 minutes.",
            "Slowly whisk the reserved 3 cups of chicken stock, a little at a time. Simmer until the stock has reduced and thickened, about 5 minutes. Add the heavy cream and stir to combine.",
            "Remove the pot from the heat and fold in the reserved 4 cups of shredded chicken, peas, and parsley. Season with more kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste. Transfer the filling to a large bowl and let cool to room temperature, then place in the freezer for 15 minutes.",
            "Assemble the pot pie: Place a portion of pie dough on a floured surface. Sprinkle flour on top of the dough and on the rolling pin, then roll the dough into a 12-inch (30 cm) round, about ⅓ inch thick, rotating 90° every few rolls. Repeat with the remaining dough, rolling out slightly thinner to ¼ inch thick. Roll the thicker dough round onto the rolling pin and transfer to a 9-inch (22 cm) glass deep dish pie plate, gently lifting and pressing so the dough is flush against the dish. Brush the inside of the dough with the egg wash, including the sides and outer rim. Add the chilled filling, spreading evenly.",
            "Drape the remaining dough round over the pie. Trim any excess dough around the edges, then pinch the top and bottom doughs together to seal. Roll the edges under, all the way around the pie dish, and crimp using the knuckle of an index finger of one hand and the thumb and index finger of the other.",
            "Brush the egg wash all over the top of the dough, getting in the grooves and sides of the pie. Use a paring knife to cut a few vents in the top to allow the steam to escape. Sprinkle flaky sea salt on top. Chill the assembled pie in the refrigerator for 20 minutes, until firm.",
            "Arrange a rack in the lower third of the oven. Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or aluminum foil.",
            "Place the pie dish on the prepared baking sheet, then transfer to the oven and bake for 40–50 minutes, rotating halfway through, until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbling.",
            "Let cool for 15–20 minutes before serving.",
            "Enjoy!"

Use the tip of the spatula or the back of a spoon to create a ½-inch-deep divot down the center of the wrist and a well in the center of the hand. Spread some of the goat cheese mixture down each finger tracing. This will help secure the string cheese fingers and create a smoother look.

Smooth with the offset spatula to create the wrist and arm, covering the pesto. Make sure to spread the goat cheese mixture over where the string cheeses attach to the hand to create a smooth look, using your fingers as needed. You may have some excess cheese mixture leftover, depending on the size of your tracing. Fill in any patches with more of the goat cheese mixture and shape the cheese to create a realistic hand shape.",

You will only need 5 pieces total.",

        "description": "Birria may be new to some of you, but this dish has been around for decades. It originated in the Mexican state of Jalisico and is often served for special occasions. We tested tons of variations to bring you a recipe for birria tacos that is worth every minute (and mess) it takes to make. Serve the tacos with pickled onions, sliced radishes, chopped fresh cilantro, lime wedges, and, of course, some consomé for delicious dipping.",
        "steps": [
            "Make the birria: Line a baking sheet with parchment paper",
            "Arrange the chuck roast and short ribs on the prepared baking sheet. Sprinkle ¼ cup salt all over the beef, making sure to coat each piece completely. Refrigerate for at least 4 hours and up to overnight.",
            "Add the ancho, guajillo and morita chiles to a medium heatproof bowl. Cover with warm water and soak until starting to soften, about 5 minutes. Remove the seeds and stems and set chiles aside.",
            "In a medium skillet over medium heat, toast the cinnamon stick, coriander, black pepper, allspice, and cloves until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Transfer the toasted spices, bay leaves, and oregano to a spice grinder or high-powered blender and grind into a fine powder.",
            "Preheat the oven to 300°F (150°C).",
            "Remove the seasoned meat from the refrigerator and use paper towels to pat dry.",
            "In a large Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed pot with a tight fitting lid, heat ¼ cup canola oil over medium-high heat. When the oil is shimmering, sear the seasoned meat on all sides until golden brown, working in batches if needed to avoid overcrowding the pot, about 20 minutes. Remove the meat from the pot and set aside. If the oil looks dark and burnt, discard and add ¼ cup fresh canola oil to the pot and return to medium-high heat.",
            "Add the yellow onion, tomatoes, and remaining tablespoon of salt to the hot oil and cook until the onion begins to sweat, 5–7 minutes. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 3 minutes.",
            "Add the ground spices and continue cooking until aromatic, about 2 minutes.",
            "Add the apple cider vinegar, water, seared meat, and chiles. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium-low and cover. Simmer until the stew begins to thicken and the chiles are completely softened, about 30 minutes.",
            "Remove the chiles from the stew and transfer to a high-powered blender with about 2 cups of the broth. Blend until smooth, then pour back into the pot and stir to combine. Cover the stew with the banana leaves, then place the lid on top. Transfer the stew to the oven and continue cooking until the meat easily pulls away from the short ribs bones, about 90 minutes. If the meat has some resistance, cover and cook longer, until very tender.",
            "Remove the stew from the oven and discard the banana leaves, then remove the meat from the pot and transfer to a large bowl. Use a pair of tongs and a fork to shred the meat to your desired texture. Reserve the broth (consomé).",
            "Make the tacos: Heat the remaining tablespoon of canola oil in a large cast iron skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Dip a tortilla in the warm consomé, then lay flat in the hot oil. Add 2 tablespoons of queso Oaxaca to one half of the tortilla and about ¼ cup of the shredded beef to the other half.  Fold the quesadilla shut and cook until the cheese begins to melt, about 1 minute. Flip the quesadilla and continue cooking until the tortilla is golden brown and crispy and the cheese is oozing from the edges, about 1 minute. Repeat with the remaining tortillas, cheese and birria.",
            "Serve the tacos with the consomé alongside for dipping as well as pickled onions, sliced radishes, chopped fresh cilantro, and lime wedges.",
            "Enjoy!"

        "description": "Butter chicken is a traditional North Indian dish also known as murgh makhani. The dish gets its name from the generous amount of butter (makhan) used in the recipe, but also from the smooth, silken, butter-like texture of the gravy used to simmer the chicken. Butter chicken is thought to have originated in restaurants in order to use up leftovers of tandoori chicken, an extremely popular dish. Like all Indian recipes, there are countless versions of butter chicken, all with nuanced variations. This is our favorite recipe for the Indian classic.",
        "steps": [
            "Make the garam masala: Add the bay leaf, cinnamon stick, cloves, cardamom pods, blcak peppercorns, cumin seeds, coriander seeds, and nutmeg to a medium skillet. Toast over medium heat for 1–2 minutes, until fragrant, but not burnt. Transfer the toasted spices to a plate and let cool.",
            "Transfer the spices to an electric spice grinder or mortar and pestle and grind into a fine powder. The garam masala will keep in an airtight container in a cool, dark place for several months.",
            "Make the ginger-garlic paste: Add the ginger, garlic, oil, and salt to a small food processor or blender and process into a smooth paste, scraping down the sides of the processor as needed.",
            "Marinate the chicken: In a large bowl, whisk together the 2 tablespoons ginger-garlic paste, 2 teaspoons garam masala, the turmeric, ground cumin, ground coriander, salt, lemon juice, Kashmiri red chile powder, and Greek yogurt until well combined. Add the chicken and toss to coat, then cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 3 hours, but ideally overnight.",
            "Add the wooden skewers to a large baking dish. Cover with enough water to completely submerge, then soak for at least 1 hour.",
            "When ready to cook the chicken, arrange an oven rack in the highest position. Turn the oven to broil on high. Set a wire rack over a rimmed baking sheet.",
            "Thread the chicken onto wooden skewers and set on the wire rack, spacing evenly. Broil for 15 minutes, until evenly browned and cooked through, turning the skewers every 5 minutes to ensure even cooking. Let cool slightly before removing chicken from the skewers. Set aside.",
            "While the chicken cooks, make the gravy: In a large, high-walled skillet, melt together the butter and olive oil over medium heat. Add the cumin seeds, cardamom pod, bay leaf, cloves, green chiles, and turmeric and sauté for 1 minute, until fragrant. Add the onion and cook for about 5 minutes, until lightly browned. Add 2 tablespoons ginger-garlic paste and cook for another minute, until fragrant. Add the ground cumin, Kashmiri red chile powder, ground coriander, and 1½ teaspoons of garam masala and stir for 1 minute, until well combined.",
            "Add the crushed tomatoes, cashews, and a pinch of salt and cook, stirring often, for 10–15 minutes, until the tomatoes are a deeper, dark red color and the cashews are soft.",
            "Transfer the tomato mixture to a high-powered blender. Add ½ cup water and blend until completely smooth, adding up to ½ cup more water if needed. If your blender is not high-powered, strain the gravy through a fine-mesh sieve after blending for a smoother texture.",
            "Wipe the pan clean, then return the gravy to the pan. Add the remaining 3 tablespoons of butter, the sugar, and the cooked chicken. Cover and cook over low heat for 10 minutes, until the chicken is warmed through. Stir in the heavy cream and fenugreek and season with more salt to taste.",
            "Garnish the butter chicken with cilantro and serve with your choice of basmati rice, onion kulcha, naan, roti, or paratha.",
            "Enjoy!"

Mofongo is super versatile, as it can be made in many different forms and is tasty no matter what it's paired with. Here, Jeremie Serrano shows us how to make a vegan version of mofongo and caldo with a zesty mojo sauce for topping.",
        "steps": [
            "Make the caldo de “pollo”: In a large pot, melt the vegan butter over medium-high heat. Add the onion and garlic paste and sauté until fragrant, 2–3 minutes. Add the vegetable stock and bouillon cube and bring to a boil. Once the bouillon cube has dissolved, reduce the heat to low, add the bay leaves, and season with salt and the pepper. Simmer for 15–20 minutes, until the flavors marry.",
            "Meanwhile, make the mojo: Dice the onion and red and green bell pepper. Transfer to a medium container with a lid and add the garlic paste, cilantro, and olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Stir to combine. Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve.",
            "Make the mofongo: In a large, high-walled pan, heat the oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Working in batches, add the plantain pieces to the hot oil and fry for 3–4 minutes, until golden brown on all sides. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain.",
            "Add a few pieces of fried plantain, some vegan butter, and garlic paste, to a mortar. Mash with the pestle until smooth, adding 1 tablespoon at a time of the caldo until the desired consistency is reached. Season to taste with adobo seasoning. Repeat with the remaining plantains.",
            "Use your hands or rubber spatula to shape the mofongo into roughly 1-cup mounds.",
            "Top the mofongo with the mojo and serve immediately with the hot caldo alongside.",

Top with 2 ounces of torn mozzarella, half of the penne alla vodka, another ounce of mozzarella, half of the basil, 2 more ounces of mozzarella, and 1 tablespoon of the reserved vodka sauce. Top with a second slice of bread, buttered side up. Cook for 4–5 minutes, until the cheese is melting and the bottom of the bread is golden brown.

In our version, we deep fry a mixture of rice and flour into crispy taco shells and fill them with deliciously tender braised short ribs, a fried egg, and flavorful gravy made from the short rib braising!",
        "steps": [
            "Season the short ribs on all sides with the salt and pepper.",
            "Turn the Instant Pot to sauté mode and set the timer to 40 minutes. Add the canola oil and heat until shimmering. Sear the short ribs on all sides until golden brown, 3–4 minutes per side. Remove the short ribs from the Instant Pot.",
            "Add the 1-inch onion pieces, crushed garlic, soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, beef stock, and sugar to the Instant Pot and stir to combine. Return the short ribs to the pot, secure the lid, and set the valve to sealing. Pressure cook for 45 minutes. Let the pressure naturally release for 15 minutes, then manually release the remaining pressure. Remove the short ribs from the Instant Pot and transfer to a bowl to cool. Strain the braising liquid, discarding the solids, and transfer to the refrigerator to cool for 1–2 hours, until the fat rises to the surface and solidifies.",
            "Once the meat is cool enough to handle, remove the bones and any tough connective tissue, and break up into bite-size pieces. Cover the meat and refrigerate until ready to use.",
            "Once the braising liquid has cooled, remove from the refrigerator. Reserve 2 tablespoons of the solidified fat and discard the rest. Reserve the braising liquid.",
            "Melt the reserved fat in a medium skillet over medium heat. Add the diced onion and cook until softened and beginning to caramelize, 8–10 minutes. Add the minced garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the ketchup and stir to incorporate. Add the flour and stir to coat evenly. Cook for 2–3 minutes, until the flour is no longer raw. Pour in the reserved braising liquid and whisk until everything is well incorporated. Bring to a simmer and cook for 4–6 minutes, until thickened. Transfer 1 cup of the gravy to a liquid measuring cup and set aside.",
            "Add the reserved short rib meat to the remaining gravy in the pan and cook until heated through, about 5 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper.",
            "Using an immersion blender, blend the reserved gravy until smooth.",
            "Make the rice taco shells: Add the steamed rice and ½ cup (60 g) flour to a food processor and pulse 10–12 times, until the rice is broken down and a sticky, dense dough begins to form.",
            "Transfer the dough to a floured surface and sprinkle with more flour. Knead for 1–2 minutes, until the dough is still tacky, but not so much that it sticks to your hands, adding more flour little by little as necessary.",
            "Portion the dough into 8 equal pieces, each about 3 ounces/the size of a lime. With wet hands, roll each piece into a smooth ball.",
            "Add the remaining 2 cups of flour to a plate or baking sheet.",
            "Set a sheet of parchment paper in front of you and spray a small circle on either side with nonstick spray. Place a rice ball on a circle and fold the other side of the parchment over to cover. Press down with a skillet to flatten the rice ball into a 4-inch-wide circle. Gently roll over the tortilla with a rolling pin to thin, if necessary.  Carefully remove the tortilla from the parchment paper and dredge in the flour. Set aside and repeat with the remaining tortillas.",
            "Heat the canola oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until the temperature reaches 375°F (190°C).",
            "Working 1 at a time, fry each tortilla for 45–60 seconds, then carefully flip (the tortilla should puff up) and fry for another minute or so, until golden brown on both sides. Remove the tortilla from the pan and shake off any excess oil, then transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain before gently placing into a taco stand to shape. Season lightly with salt. Repeat with the remaining tortillas.",
            "Assemble the tacos: Fill each rice tortilla with about ½ cup of the short rib meat. Top each taco with a fried egg and drizzle with the gravy. Garnish with green onions and black pepper.",

Add the butter and whisk until incorporated, 1–2 minutes. Slowly drizzle in the cream and whisk to combine. Boil for 1 minute, then remove the pot from the heat. Whisk in the vanilla and flaky salt. Transfer to an airtight container, straining through a fine-mesh sieve to remove any lumps, if needed, then refrigerate to thicken and cool completely before using, about 1 hour.",

Remove the meat from the bones and transfer the meat to a fine-mesh strainer set over a small bowl to catch any remaining liquid. Pour the remaining liquid in the pot, along with the meat drippings, through the strainer into a medium bowl. Chill in the refrigerator for 20–30 minutes, until the fat rises to the surface. Skim off the fat and discard.",

            "Unroll the refrigerated pie crust onto the prepared baking sheet. Pour the blueberry filling onto the center of the crust and spread evenly, leaving a 2-inch border around the edges. Going in one direction, fold the dough border over the filling, creating creases by using your fingers to tuck the dough under itself every 2–3 inches. Sprinkle the pecan crumble on top of the filling. Chill the galette in the refrigerator for 15 minutes.",
            "In a small bowl, whisk together the egg and water.",
            "Once the galette has chilled, use a pastry brush to brush the egg wash over the crust, then sprinkle with the coarse sugar.",
            "Bake the galette for 25 minutes, then rotate the pan and bake for another 20–25 minutes, or until golden brown and the filling is set. If the crust starts to brown too much, tent the edges of the galette loosely with foil. Remove the galette from the oven and let rest for 1 hour before serving.",
            "Slice the galette into 6–8 pieces and serve topped with a scoop of ice cream and a sprinkle of chopped pecans.",

Paired with homemade tequila-pickled vegetables provide a tangy crunch, while creamy guacamole and queso panela help cool things off. We brush store-bought burger buns with egg wash, sprinkle with coarse sea salt, and toast in the oven for a finishing touch.",
        "steps": [
            "Make the tequila pickles: In a large, high-walled skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the carrots, jalapeño, onion, and garlic and sauté, stirring constantly, until the vegetables start to become tender but do not change color, about 3 minutes. Transfer the vegetables to a 16-ounce airtight, heat-proof container.",

Pour the mixture over the vegetables and let sit for 10 minutes. Add the ice to the container and stir until completely melted. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use. The pickles can be made up to 1 week ahead.",
            "Make the guacamole: In a large bowl, combine the lime juice, garlic, and Fresno chile. Let sit at room temperature for 10 minutes. Add the avocados and salt and use a fork to mash together. Cover with plastic wrap, pressing directly against the surface of the guacamole. Refrigerate until ready to use.",

Add the panko bread crumbs, cilantro, scallions, jalapeño, salt, cumin, paprika, and eggs.  Stir with a wooden spoon to combine. Shape the mixture into 4 patties. Place the patties on a plate and refrigerate for 30 minutes.",
            "Meanwhile, place the intact burger buns on a baking sheet. Brush the top of each bun with the beaten egg, then top with the sea salt. Transfer to the oven and bake until the egg wash turns golden brown, about 5 minutes.",

Top homemade pizza dough with mozzarella and Pecorino Romano cheese and lots of freshly ground black pepper. Then, finish with a swirl of Parmesan cream that will leave your taste buds wanting more. We add a bit of crushed ice to the center of the pizza dough before baking to create a slightly sticky surface that will help the cheese melt into a sauce and prevent the center of the crust from burning.",
        "steps": [
            "Make the pizza dough: In a large bowl, combine the flour and warm water and stir with your hands until a shaggy mass forms (it will be a little dry, but will hydrate after resting). Cover the bowl with a kitchen towel and let the dough rest at room temperature for 20 minutes.",
            "Uncover the bowl and sprinkle the yeast and salt over the dough. Stir with a wooden spoon until the yeast and salt are evenly distributed.",
            "Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until a smooth ball forms, about 10 minutes. It will be very sticky because of the high hydration. Try not to use too much extra flour; instead use a bench scraper or flat metal spatula to scrape the dough from the surface and continue kneading. You can also dip your palms in flour to help keep the dough from sticking.",
            "Grease a clean large bowl with 1 tablespoon of olive oil, then place the dough in the bowl, cover with the kitchen towel, and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 90 minutes. Remove the towel and loosely cover the bowl with plastic wrap, then place in the refrigerator overnight.",

            "Remove the dough from the refrigerator and let come to room temperature, about 30 minutes.",

            "Return the pizza to the oven and continue baking until the cheese is completely melted, about 4 minutes more.",

            "Make the bao dough: In a medium bowl, combine the flour, sugar, yeast, vegetable oil and ⅓ cup warm water and stir to combine. Slowly add the remaining 2 tablespoons of water, mixing constantly. Knead the dough in the bowl until smooth and well combined. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let the dough rise for about 1 hour, until doubled in size.",

            "In a medium nonstick pan, sauté the onion over medium-low heat until translucent, 1 minute. Add the chopped char siu, sauce, and water. Stir to combine, then simmer until the sauce thickens, 2 minutes. Transfer the filling to a medium bowl and chill in the refrigerator for about 1 hour, until cool.",
            "After rising, punch the dough down and knead until it is back to its original size. On a lightly floured surface, divide the dough into 5 48-gram balls. Flatten and roll out each portion, making sure the middle is thick while the sides are thin. Hold a dough round in the palm of your hand and add 36 grams of the char siu filling to the center. Use your other hand to pinch the edges of the dough together up and over the filling while rotating the bao in your hand.",
            "Place each bao on a small square of parchment paper. Set in a steamer basket, cover, and let rise for about 15 minutes, until slightly puffed, before steaming.",
            "Fill the bottom of a steamer or double boiler with water and bring to a boil. Add the steamer basket with the bao, cover, and steam for 15 minutes, then turn off the flame and let rest in the steamer for 5 minutes before serving.",

We grew up eating this often with our family. It’s simple, yet so delicious. In this recipe, we drizzle the dipping sauce over the sliced beef, which looks like a waterfall (nam tok).",

            "Add the steak to the air fryer and cook for 5–6 minutes on each side, until caramelized on the outside and the internal temperature registers 135–145°F (57–63°C) on an instant read thermometer, depending on your desired doneness. Transfer the steak to a cutting board and let rest for 10 minutes.",
            "Meanwhile, make the jeow: In a medium bowl, stir together the fish sauce, sugar, MSG, chile flakes, toasted rice powder, kaffir lime leaves, lime juice, and scallions until the sugar is dissolved. Stir in the bird’s eye chiles. Set aside until ready to serve.",
            "Thinly slice the steak against the grain. Drizzle the jeow over top and garnish with the mint and cilantro. Serve with sticky rice.",

        "steps": [
            "Make the brisket: Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C).",
            "Place the brisket in a roasting pan or on a rimmed baking sheet. In a small bowl, combine 3 tablespoons of kosher salt and the black pepper, then sprinkle evenly across the entire brisket, making sure to cover the edges as well.",
            "Roast the brisket until a crust begins to form, about 1 hour. Reduce the oven temperature to 300°F (150°C). Cover the brisket with foil and continue roasting until the internal temperature reaches 190°F (88°F) on a meat thermometer, about 2 hours. Remove the brisket from the oven and let rest for 20 minutes. Keep the oven on.",
            "Transfer the brisket to a cutting board and dice into 1-inch pieces. Return the brisket cubes to the pan.",
            "While the brisket is resting, make the sauce: In a small saucepan over medium-high heat, boil the cola until reduced by half, about 5 minutes. Add the barbecue sauce, brown sugar, Worcestershire sauce, and soy sauce. Stir to combine, then bring to a boil.",
            "Pour the sauce over the brisket cubes and toss to coat. Place the roasting pan, uncovered, into the oven and continue cooking until the sauce becomes thick and syrupy, about 1 hour.",
            "Make the biscuits: Increase the oven temperature to 400°F (200°C). Line a 9 x 13-inch baking sheet with parchment paper.",
            "In a large bowl, whisk together the flour and 1 teaspoon salt. Place a box grater in the center of the bowl and grate the chilled butter into the flour. Remove the box grater and pour the buttermilk into the bowl. Toss with your hands until a shaggy dough forms.",
            "Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and flatten into a small square. Use a bench scraper to cut the dough in half and stack one half on top of the other, then press down again. Continue cutting and stacking until all of the flour is hydrated. Once the dough comes together, roll out to about 2 inches thick. Using a 3-inch round cutter, cut out 12 rounds and place on the prepared baking sheet.",
            "Bake the biscuits until the tops are golden brown, about 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and brush the tops with the melted butter, then sprinkle with coarse sea salt.",
            "Split the biscuits in half and place a couple pieces of brisket onto the bottom halves. Drizzle with some of the sauce and top each with 2 pickle chips. Place the tops of the biscuit on to complete the sandwiches.",
            "Make the watermelon feta salad: In a large bowl, whisk together the lime juice, vinegar, chile lime seasoning, and honey. Slowly drizzle in the olive oil and continue whisking until emulsified.",
            "Add the watermelon, pineapple, serrano, feta, cilantro, and mint. Toss to coat evenly. Refrigerate until ready to serve.",
            "Make the corn ribs: Preheat the air fryer to 375°F (190°C).",
            "Cut the corn ears in half crosswise. Cut each corn half lengthwise into quarters.",
            "In a small bowl, whisk together the melted butter and ancho chile powder. Brush the corn ribs with ancho butter.",
            "Working in batches, arrange the corn ribs a single layer in the air fryer basket. Cook for about 15 minutes, until the kernels begin to crisp at the edges and turn golden brown in the centers.",
            "In a small bowl, whisk together the mayonnaise and sour cream. Transfer to a small zip-top bag and cut a small opening at the tip.",
            "Assemble the board: Set the ribs on a large board. Stack the corn ribs on the board and drizzle with the sour cream-mayonnaise mixture, then top with the Cotija cheese and cilantro. Fill the rest of the board with the brisket biscuits, watermelon feta salad, coleslaw, baked beans, macaroni salad, kielbasa, lime wedges, watermelon slices, and cornbread.",

            "Make the marbled sandwich cookies: Tap the bottle of black food coloring in the bottom of 1–2 sandwich cookie molds so that a small amount of food coloring transfers to the bottom of the mold(s). Top with a spoonful of the marbled chocolate and swirl with a toothpick to create a prominent marbled look. Gently place a cookie in the center of the mold(s), being careful not to push all the way to the bottom, and top with more of the colored white chocolate, smoothing the surface and wiping the edges clean. Tap the mold on the counter a few times to release any air bubbles. If using a clear mold, look around the sides to be sure the white chocolate completely encases the cookie(s).",

Let everything set at room temperature for 20–30 minutes.",

        "description": "Fool your friends or boost your brunch game with this fun spin on the classic short stack of pancakes. Stacks of larger-than-average macarons are sandwiched together with a layer of maple buttercream, then decorated with more buttercream disguised as whipped cream and pats of butter, blueberry jam, mini chocolate chips, and maple syrup. That’s some macaron magic if you ask us!",
        "steps": [
            "Make the macarons: In the bowl of a food processor, combine the powdered sugar, almond flour, and ½ teaspoon of salt and process on low speed, until extra-fine. Sift the almond flour mixture through a fine-mesh sieve into a large bowl.",
            "In a separate large bowl, beat the egg whites and the remaining ½ teaspoon of salt on medium-high with an electric hand mixer or in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment until soft peaks form. Gradually add the granulated sugar until fully incorporated. Continue to beat until stiff peaks form (you should be able to turn the bowl upside down without anything falling out).",
            "Add the vanilla and golden yellow gel food coloring and beat until just combined.",
            "Add about ⅓ of the sifted almond flour mixture at a time to the beaten egg whites and use a spatula to gently fold until combined. After the last addition of almond flour, continue to fold slowly until the batter falls into ribbons with jagged edges and you can make a figure 8 while holding the spatula up. Transfer the macaron batter to a piping bag fitted with a medium round (#12) tip.",
            "Grease 2 rimmed baking sheets with nonstick spray and place a piece of parchment paper over each sheet, using the spray to help adhere the parchment to the pans.",
            "Pipe the macarons onto the parchment paper in 2½-inch (6¼-cm) circles, spacing at least 1 inch (2 cm) apart. You should have 8 per pan. Tap the baking sheets on a flat surface 5 times to release any air bubbles.",
            "Let the macarons sit at room temperature for 1–2 hours, until dry to the touch.",
            "Preheat the oven to 300°F (150°C).",
            "Bake the macarons for 27–30 minutes, until the feet are well-risen and the macarons don’t stick to the parchment paper when lifted. Transfer the macarons to a wire rack to cool completely before filling.",
            "Make the buttercream: Microwave the maple syrup in a medium heat-proof glass bowl for 90 seconds on high power. Let the syrup cool for at least 20 minutes, until warm but not hot. Warning: the syrup and bowl will be very hot; use caution.",
            "In a large bowl, cream the butter with an electric hand mixer on high speed for 1 minute, until light and fluffy. Sift in the powdered sugar and beat until fully incorporated. Add the vanilla and beat to combine. Add the cream and beat to incorporate.",
            "Add the cooled maple syrup to the buttercream and beat on high speed until smooth, scraping the sides as needed. Note: If the syrup has cooled to the point of hardening, microwave in 5-second intervals until pourable.",
            "Transfer 1 tablespoon of the buttercream to a small bowl. Add the yellow gel food coloring and stir until combined. Spread the yellow buttercream in a thin, even layer, about 2½ inches square, on a piece of parchment paper. Cover with another piece of parchment paper and smooth. Transfer to the freezer until ready to assemble the macarons.",
            "Transfer ⅔ cup of the maple buttercream to a medium bowl. Add the brown gel food coloring and stir until combined.",
            "Transfer ¼ cup of the remaining uncolored maple buttercream to a piping bag fitted with a small open star (#14) tip. Transfer the remaining uncolored buttercream to a piping bag fitted with a medium round (#12) tip. Set aside.",
            "Spread about 1 teaspoon of brown buttercream onto the rounded tops of half of the macaron shells, leaving a ¼ inch border around the edges. Use a clean paintbrush to carefully (the macaron shells are fragile) clean up the edges of the buttercream.",
            "Use the maple buttercream in the piping bag fitted with the round tip to pipe a thin swirl of buttercream on the rounded tops of the remaining macaron shells, leaving at least a ½ inch border around the edges.",
            "Place a brown-painted macaron shell on top of each buttercream-frosted macaron shell.",
            "Place the macarons in an airtight container for 24 hours to “bloom,” prior to decorating, if desired.",
            "To decorate, use the maple buttercream in the piping bag fitted with the round tip to pipe about 2 teaspoons of buttercream on top of 4 macaron stacks to look like whipped cream. Use the tip of a butter knife to make a small well in the center of the buttercream. Scoop about 1 teaspoon of blueberry jam into each well. Use the tip of the knife to help the jam flow over the edges of the “whipped cream.”",
            "Remove the yellow buttercream sheet from the freezer. Peel off the top layer of parchment. Use a sharp knife to cut the buttercream into 12 squares (they will be fragile). Run a butter knife under the squares to release from the parchment and use the flat side of the knife to transfer 2 butter pats to the top of each of the remaining 4 macaron stacks (don’t use your fingers; the buttercream will soften quickly.) Use the maple buttercream in the piping bag fitted with the open star tip to pipe “whipped cream” next to the butter pats. Sprinkle each stack with ½ teaspoon mini chocolate chips. Note: If chocolate chips aren’t sticking to the macarons, apply a small dot of buttercream on the bottom of each chip.",
            "When ready to serve, transfer the macarons on a serving platter and pour maple syrup over the top.",

            "Preheat the oven to 200°F (95°C).",
            "In a blender, combine the egg, melted butter, flour, granulated sugar, milk, and salt. Blend on medium-high speed until smooth.",
            "Melt ½ teaspoon butter in a 9-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat until bubbling. Pour in a scant ½ cup of batter and swirl to coat the bottom of the pan. 4. Cook for 2 minutes, until set and golden brown in spots on the bottom. Flip and cook for another 30–60 seconds, until cooked through and golden brown. Transfer to a baking sheet and cover with a kitchen towel while you repeat to make the remaining 3 crepes. Keep the crepes warm in the oven while you make the filling.",
            "Wipe out the pan and return to medium-high heat. Add the walnuts and toast for 3–5 minutes, until fragrant and beginning to brown. Remove from the pan and let cool.",
            "Wipe out the pan and return to medium heat. Melt the remaining 4 tablespoons of butter until bubbling. Stir in the brown sugar and cinnamon and cook until dissolved, about 2 minutes. Stir in the water and cook for 3–4 minutes, until the sauce is darkened and reduced. Pour in the rum and stir to combine. Cook for 1 minute, until the alcohol burns off. Fold in the bananas and cook for 1–2 minutes, until softened and glossy.",
            "Place a crepe on a clean surface. Spoon ½ cup of the bananas onto the center of the crepe; it’s okay if some of the sauce gets into the crepe. Fold the edges of the crepe inward to create a square pocket, leaving some of the filling exposed in the center. Repeat with the remaining crepes and filling. You should have plenty of sauce left over.",
            "Plate each crepe and top with a scoop of ice cream and 2 tablespoons of the toasted walnuts. Generously drizzle each crepe with a couple tablespoons of the leftover sauce.",
            "Serve immediately.",

Spread another cup buttercream evenly over the top and sides to create a crumb coat. Cover and set the remaining buttercream aside until ready to decorate. Refrigerate the cake until ready to decorate.",
            "Make the meringue mushrooms: Preheat the oven to 225°F (105°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.",

Whip the mixture until stiff peaks form, about 3 minutes. Add the vanilla and beat on medium-low speed until just combined. Transfer the meringue into a piping bag fitted with a ½-inch (1.24 cm) round tip.",
            "To make the mushroom caps, hold the piping bag upright and squeeze the meringue firmly onto half of the prepared baking sheet into disc shapes ranging from ½ inch (1.24 cm) to 1½ (3.81 cm) inches in diameter, leaving at least ½ inch (1.24 cm) of space between each cap. You should use about ⅔ of the meringue. Dip your finger in water and smooth the top of each cap. Your fingers will create natural dimples and watermarks to mimic the look of mushrooms caps.",
            "To make the mushroom stems, hold the piping bag upright and squeeze the remaining meringue firmly onto the other half of the baking sheet in ½-inch and 1-inch long pieces, leaving at least ½ inch of space between each stem. The number of stems should match the number of caps.",
            "Bake the meringue mushrooms for about 3 hours, until the caps and stems feel dry to the touch and are light beige in color. Remove from the oven and let the meringues cool completely.",

Let the ganache cool to room temperature, about 1 hour; it should be thick and have the texture of frosting. Once cool, add ⅓ of the ganache to a piping bag fitted with a ½-inch round tip and the remaining ganache to a piping bag fitted with a 1-inch round tip.",
            "Make the edible moss:  Pulse the pistachios and matcha powder in a food processor until coarsely ground, being careful not to process into a paste. Set aside until ready to decorate.",
            "Make the buttercream flowers: Divide the buttercream frosting evenly between 5 medium bowls. Add the violet, pink, yellow, avocado, and mauve food coloring to each bowl and stir until well combined. Transfer each color frosting to a separate piping bag fitted with tips to pipe flowers and leaves. Set aside until ready to decorate.",

Using the bag with the ½-inch tip, pipe the ganache in a swirl on top of the cake, starting from the center and working toward the outer edge. Use a fork to swirl the ganache and buttercream together to make the top of the tree stump.",
            "Using the bag with the 1-inch tip, pipe the remaining ganache onto the sides of the cake and spread to coat completely. Use a fork to draw lines vertically up the sides of the cake for the tree bark.",

        "steps": [
            "Make the horseradish herb sauce: In a medium bowl, stir together the horseradish, mayonnaise, sour cream, chives, parsley, apple cider vinegar, and salt. Cover with plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator until ready to serve.",
            "Make the spicy mustard sauce: In a small bowl, stir together the mayonnaise, spicy brown mustard, apple cider vinegar, and honey. Cover with plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator until ready to serve.",
            "Make the empanadas: Heat the canola oil in a medium pot over medium-high heat until it reaches 350°F (180°C). Set a wire rack over a baking sheet.",
            "In a 4-quart food processor, combine the corned beef, sauerkraut, carrots, cabbage, parsley, pepper, coriander, mustard seeds, ground mustard, and 2 teaspoons salt. Pulse for 30 seconds, until well combined and everything is finely ground. Add the potatoes and pulse for 10–15 seconds more, until the potatoes are very finely chopped but still visible.",
            "Transfer the filling to a sieve set over a bowl and use a rubber spatula to press out any excess liquid.",
            "In a small bowl, beat together the eggs and water.",
            "Lay 2 empanada dough rounds on a clean surface and brush all over with egg wash. Set a 3-inch clover cookie cutter in the center of one of the dough rounds and fill with 1–1½ teaspoons of the filling, mounding in the center of the mold. Remove the cutter and cover the filling with the other dough round, egg wash-side down. Press down firmly with the cookie cutter to seal the filling inside. Using your fingers or a fork, press the edges of the empanada dough together to seal, discarding the dough scraps. Repeat with the remaining dough and filling.",
            "Working in batches of 3–4, gently lower the empanadas into the hot oil and fry for 7–10 minutes, flipping once, until golden brown on both sides. Use a spider to transfer the empanadas to the wire rack and sprinkle with a pinch of salt.",
            "Serve the empanadas hot with the horseradish herb sauce and spicy mustard sauce for dipping.",

A cross between a burrito and arancini, this recipe features taco-spiced ground beef and cheese wrapped in layers of refried beans and cilantro-lime rice, then coated in crushed tortillas chips and fried to golden-brown perfection.",
        "steps": [
            "Melt the butter and olive oil together in a large, high-walled skillet over medium heat. When the butter begins to bubble, add the onion and sauté for 3–4 minutes, until translucent. Add the rice and stir to coat. Toast the rice for 3–4 minutes, until fragrant.",
            "Add the hot chicken broth, ½ cup (120 ml) at a time, stirring continuously and adding more liquid once it is mostly absorbed, until the rice is creamy and tender, but not mushy, 35–40 minutes total. Season with ½ teaspoon salt.",
            "Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the lime zest and juice. Let the rice cool for 5–10 minutes, then stir in the cilantro. Transfer the rice to a baking sheet or plate and spread in an even layer. Let cool enough to handle.",
            "In a medium bowl, combine the ground beef, shredded cheese, and hot sauce, if using.",
            "Make the burrito bombs: Using gloved hands, roll 2 tablespoons of the ground beef mixture into a ball. Cover the beef ball in about ¼ cup of refried beans, rolling into a smooth ball. Wrap the bean layer in about ⅓ cup of the cooled rice, rolling into a smooth ball. Repeat with remaining ingredients. Transfer the burrito bombs to the refrigerator while you heat the oil and prepare the breading station.",
            "Fill a large pot ¾ of the way with canola oil. Heat over medium-high heat until the temperature reaches 375°F (190°C). Set a wire rack over a baking sheet.",
            "Add the flour, eggs, and crushed tortilla chips to 3 separate shallow bowls. Roll each burrito bomb in the flour, then the egg, then in the tortilla crumbs. Set on a baking sheet.",
            "Working in batches of 2–3, fry the burrito bombs in the hot oil for 6–7 minutes, until golden brown. Transfer to the wire rack to drain, season each burrito bomb with salt, and let cool slightly.",
            "Serve the burrito bombs with salsa, guacamole, crema, hot sauce, and lime wedges.",

The deep spices in the chicken are offset by the rich browned-butter waffles that only get better when drizzled with syrup and hot sauce for a sweet and spicy finish.",

Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or overnight. When ready to use, remove the chicken wings from the brine and pat dry with paper towels. Transfer to a wire rack set over a baking sheet.",

            "Working with 2–3 wings at a time, fry the chicken in the hot oil until golden brown and the internal temperature reaches 160-165°F (70-75°C). Remove the chicken from the oil, sprinkle on both sides with a pinch of the reserved spice mix, then set on a clean wire rack set over a baking sheet to cool. Repeat with the remaining chicken. When finished frying, transfer the chicken to the oven to keep warm until ready to serve.",

Cook, stirring occasionally, until the butter turns dark brown and smells nutty, between 7-10 minutes. Watch carefully and focus on color, so the butter does not burn, aiming from brown not black bits. Remove the pot from the heat.",
            "Add an ice cube to the butter and slowly let it melt. It may froth and bubble. Add the remaining ice cube and gently stir until melted. Pour ½ cup of the browned butter into a liquid measuring cup or heatproof bowl and let cool completely, about 5 minutes. Store any remaining browned butter in the refrigerator for another use.",
            "Preheat a waffle iron to medium-high heat.",
            "In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.",

Set the waffles on a baking sheet as they finish cooking and transfer to the oven with the chicken to keep warm until ready to serve.",
            "To serve, place a waffle on each plate (either whole or cut into 4 pieces) and set 2–3 wings on top of or next to each waffle. Top the waffles with butter, maple syrup, and/or hot sauce, if desired. Serve hot.",
            "Any leftover waffles can be wrapped individually in plastic wrap, then placed in a zip-top bag and stored in the refrigerator for up to 2 days.",

While the duck breasts cure, the carcass is used to make a fragrant stock that is delicious for sipping, or thickened into a jus to ladle over the sliced duck.",
        "steps": [
            "Place a wire rack on top of a rimmed baking sheet.",
            "Set the duck breasts on the rack and, using a sharp knife, carefully score the fat by slicing diagonally across each breast in a cross-hatch pattern at ½-inch intervals, taking care not to slice into the flesh. Season each duck breast on both sides with the salt.",
            "In a spice grinder, combine the Sichuan peppercorns, Earl Grey tea leaves, and allspice berries and coarsely grind until evenly mixed.",
            "Evenly coat each duck breast all over with about 1½ tablespoons of the spice blend. Turn the duck breasts fat-side down on the rack and transfer to the refrigerator to cure uncovered for 24 hours, until the fat is somewhat dried out and firm.",
            "Make the duck stock: In a large pot, melt the duck fat over medium heat. Add the coriander seeds and sauté for 1 minute, until fragrant. Add the onion, garlic, and ginger and season with salt. Sauté until the onion is translucent, 4–6 minutes.",
            "Pour in the Shaoxing wine, stirring to scrape up any browned bits on the bottom of the pot, about 1 minute.",
            "Add the duck carcass, 2 teaspoons salt, and the sugar. Add enough water to cover the carcass by at least 4 inches. Bring to a simmer. Skim off any scum that rises to the surface, then reduce the heat to low, cover, and cook the stock for 8 hours, or overnight.",
            "Uncover, increase the heat to high, and cook until the stock has reduced by half, 30–45 minutes.",
            "Strain the stock, discarding the solids, and season with salt to taste. Set aside. Store any leftover stock in the fridge for up to 5 days, or the freezer for up to 3 months.",
            "Remove the duck breasts from the refrigerator and let it come to room temperature, about 1 hour.",
            "Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C).",
            "Place the duck breasts skin-side down in a cold, large, oven-safe pan. Place over medium-low heat and cook for 10–15 minutes to slowly render the duck fat, leaving a sliver of skin over the breasts. Increase the heat to medium-high to give the duck skin a final sear until golden brown and crisp, 1–2 minutes.",
            "Flip the duck breasts skin-side up and transfer the pan to the oven for about 5 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 130°F (55°C) for medium-rare, or to your desired doneness. Through carryover cooking, the internal temperature will continue to rise by 5–10° during resting.",
            "Let the duck breasts rest for 5 minutes before slicing crosswise into ½-inch slices.",
            "Heat 1 cup (240 ml) of stock in a small pot over medium heat until gently simmering.",
            "In a small bowl, whisk together the cornstarch and ½ cup water to form a slurry. Add the slurry to the duck stock and cook for 2–3 minutes, until the stock thickens into a jus. Season the stock with more salt and sugar to taste.",
            "Ladle the hot jus over the sliced duck breast just before serving.",
            "Enjoy!"

She teaches him that just 4 simple ingredients can transform into a lacy, crispy and delicious side dish. Her secret is incorporating the leftover potato starch that remains in the bottom of the bowl after grating the potatoes.",

Set the liquid aside to let the starch settle to the bottom of the bowl, then carefully pour off the liquid on top, leaving the potato starch in the bottom of the bowl.",
            "In a clean large bowl, combine the shredded potatoes and onions, potato starch, 1 egg, salt, and pepper and gently mix to combine. If the mixture seems too dry and crumbly, add another egg. Add 1 tablespoon matzo ball mix and stir to incorporate, adding up to 1 tablespoon more matzo ball mix if the mixture isn’t holding together.",
            "Pour the oil into a large pan to reach a depth of ¼ inch. Heat over medium heat. Using a 2-tablespoon cookie scoop, add the potato mixture to the pan, gently pressing down to the desired thickness. Add another scoop or two of the potato mixture, being careful not to overcrowd the pan. Cook for 3–4 minutes until the edges begin to crisp and the bottom is golden brown. Carefully flip the latkes and cook for another 3–4 minutes, until golden brown on the other side. Transfer to a wire rack and season with salt. Repeat with the remaining latkes.",

Then she rubs a homemade adobo seasoning all over to tenderize the meat and add tons of flavor. She pairs her roasted chicken with savory giblet gravy so nothing goes to waste. Bonus tip: Save any bones to turn into chicken stock the following day!",

Use kitchen shears or a sharp knife to cut along each side of the backbone to remove (set aside to make stock, if desired). Flip the chicken over and splay the thighs. Stack your hands between the breasts and press down firmly to flatten until you hear the breastbone crack.",

            "Flip the bird over. Use a metal skewer to poke the chicken skin all over. Carefully use your fingers to separate the skin from the meat over the breasts and thighs. Rub the clarified butter under the chicken skin, using your fingertips over the skin to spread the butter evenly. Sprinkle the remaining adobo seasoning over the chicken skin.",
            "Set the chicken on the wire rack. Chill in the refrigerator, uncovered, for 1–24 hours.",
            "Before roasting, remove the chicken from the refrigerator and let come to room temperature for 45 minutes.",
            "Preheat the oven 475°F (245°C).",
            "Transfer the chicken to the oven and roast for about 50 minutes, or until an instant-read thermometer registers 165°F (75°C) when inserted into the thickest part of the thigh and the skin is golden brown. Remove the chicken from the oven and let rest for about 10 minutes.",
            "Meanwhile, make the giblet gravy: Remove the giblets from the bag and separate the meat from any skin, fat, or bones. Add the giblets to a medium saucepan with enough water to cover by 1 inch. Cook over medium heat until the giblets are tender, about 20 minutes. Remove from the pan, draining any excess water, and finely chop the meat. Clean the pan.",
            "Melt the butter in the same saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic and cook until softened, about 1 minute. Sprinkle in the flour and cook, stirring continuously, for 2–3 minutes, or until golden brown.",

            "Ingredients": [
                "¼ cup Organic rye or whole wheat flour (50 g)",
                "Filtered or distilled room-temperature water ()"

        "description": "Starting a sourdough starter isn’t hard, but it does require patience. It may seem daunting that this recipe takes 1–2 weeks to complete, but it only takes about 2 minutes of active prep time each day, and you’ll reap the rewards when you pull your first (and each subsequent) loaf from the oven. The heart of baking great sourdough bread is a healthy and predictable starter, which makes the bread taste better. My foolproof method is outlined in the recipe below. I use rye flour because it is densely packed with nutrients and protein to benefit the formation of wild yeast and bacteria to make your starter strong from the beginning, but organic whole wheat flour works well, too. Make sure your water is unchlorinated, or microbial growth will be inhibited. Either use filtered or distilled water, or let your water sit out overnight (cover with cheesecloth to keep out debris) so the chlorine evaporates before adding to your starter.",
        "steps": [
            "Day 1: In a small container with a lid, mix 50 grams of rye flour with 50 grams of water. Loosely cover the container, then let sit at room temperature for 2 days.",
            "Days 2–4: Each day, check your starter for activity. You should start to see bubbles forming on top and smell fermentation and alcohol, this is all normal and means that your starter is active. (If there is a thin layer of strong-smelling liquid on top, don’t worry! It is just alcohol forming due to fast fermentation, which is a good thing, as it means the starter is really active already! When feeding your starter, use slightly cooler water, or increase the amount of flour used by 10 grams to slow down the fermentation process and keep to a daily feeding schedule.)",
            "Once you start to see activity, discard 75% of the starter. Dissolve the remaining starter in 50 grams of fresh water, then stir in 50 grams of flour (see Note).",
            "Days 4–14: Continue to feed your starter at roughly the same time each day, using the same type of flour and temperature of water. Consistency is the most important thing. Eventually, your starter will get into a predictable rhythm of rising and falling, looking the same at similar points in time each day.  This can take up to 2 weeks, so be patient!",
            "Once your starter is behaving consistently from day to day, it is healthy and can be used to bake bread.",
            "Note: Discard can be thrown away or reserved in a separate jar in the refrigerator and used to make other baked goods, such as crackers, scallion pancakes, banana bread, and pasta.",
            "Enjoy!"

Chocoflan, a Mexican dessert, is known as “The Impossible Cake” because the cake and the flan layers never mix and actually switch positions during baking. It’s chocolate cake on the bottom, flan on top, with a drizzle of cajeta (caramelized goat’s milk) or caramel for full-on #dessertgoals.",

Carefully transfer the cake pan from the water bath to a wire rack and remove the foil.

Arrange the oysters on the platter, nestling the shells into the salt.  Transfer to the oven and bake for 12–15 minutes, or until the cheesy bread crumbs have browned.",

The crust is crunchy, while the crumb is springy and delicious. The recipe calls for bread flour and whole wheat flour, but if you only have all-purpose flour, use 375 grams (1 ½ cups plus 2 tablespoons) water instead of 400 grams for the initial mix.",
        "steps": [
            "Autolyse: Add 400 grams of warm water and the sourdough starter to a medium bowl. Stir with a rubber spatula to dissolve the starter.",
            "Add the bread flour and whole wheat flour. Use a spatula or your clean hands to mix until combined and there are no dry spots. Cover with a clean cotton kitchen towel and let sit in a warm place for 60 minutes.",
            "Bulk fermentation: After resting the dough, add the salt and remaining 10 grams water. Use your hands to incorporate the salt, squishing the dough through your fingers to make sure it is evenly distributed.",
            "Set a bowl of water nearby. Once the salt is incorporated, dip your hand in the water to prevent sticking. Use your wet hand to stretch the dough from the edge of the bowl upwards, then fold toward the center. Repeat a total of 8 times, rotating the bowl slightly after each fold.",
            "After the folds, carefully lift the dough up, flip it over, place it back in the bowl and tuck the edges under the dough. Scrape down the edges of the bowl, then cover with the kitchen towel and let rest in a warm place for 60 minutes.",
            "Repeat the stretching and folding process 2 more times, waiting 60 minutes after each folding session before beginning again. You should see signs of fermentation in the form of an increase in volume and bubbles along the edges and top of the dough. Wait a little longer, up to 30 more minutes between folds, if you don’t see those signs yet.",
            "Preshape: An hour after the final stretch and fold, dip your hands in the water. Think of the dough as the face of a clock. Slide your hands into the bowl at 3 o’clock and 9 o’clock. Partially lift the dough from the bowl and let it fold under itself. Rotate the bowl and repeat the lifting and fold under 5-6 times, until dough has begun to come together in a ball.",
            "Carefully lift the dough onto a clean surface. Lightly sprinkle the dough with the dusting flour. Using a bench scraper, or lightly floured hands, carefully rotate and drag the dough towards yourself along the surface, building tension until you have a round, taut ball of dough. Do not make the ball too tight, as it may tear. Lightly flour the dough, cover with the towel, and let rest for 30–40 minutes.",
            "Final shape: Dust a proofing basket or a medium bowl lined with a cotton towel lightly with flour.",
            "After 40 minutes, the dough should look relaxed and have spread out slightly. Lightly flour the top of the dough again. Using the bench scraper, or a silicone spatula and lightly floured hands, carefully flip the dough over, so the unfloured part is facing upwards.",
            "Think of the clock again. Fold in 12 o’clock towards the center, then 6 o’clock, 3 o’clock, and 9 o’clock, then each of the remaining 4 diagonal corners. Carefully transfer the dough, seam-side up, to the prepared proofing basket or bowl. Pinch the seams to ensure they are sealed. Cover the bowl with the towel.",
            "Final proof: Transfer the dough to the refrigerator to finish proofing overnight, 12–18 hours. If you want to bake the same day, leave at room temperature for 2–3 hours, then transfer to the refrigerator while you preheat the oven. (Overnight proofing is highly recommended!)",
            "When you are ready to bake, preheat the oven to 500°F (260°C). Place a Dutch oven or cast iron combo cooker in the oven while it preheats. Make sure your oven has come up to temperature before baking, at least 30 minutes.",
            "Prepare a piece of parchment paper about the size of the bottom of your baking vessel. Place the parchment over the proofing basket and gently flip the basket over so the dough drops onto the parchment.",
            "Carefully remove the baking vessel from the oven. Use the parchment paper to carefully lift the dough into the pan. Use a sharp paring knife or bread lame to slash the top of the dough a few times. This scoring will allow steam to escape. Cover the vessel with the lid and carefully place in the oven.",
            "Bake for 25 minutes, then remove the lid and reduce the oven temperature to 450°F (230°C). Continue baking for another 15–20 minutes, until the crust is amber brown.",
            "Remove the bread from the oven and carefully transfer to a wire rack. Check to make sure it is done baking by tapping on the bottom--you should hear a hollow sound. Though it may be tempting to dive right in, let the bread cool completely, at least 2 hours, before slicing with a serrated knife.",
            "Store the loaf cut-side down on a cutting board, or in a plastic bag. You can freeze the whole loaf, or pre-slice, then freeze and pull out slices as needed.",
            "Notes: If you are using all-purpose flour, use 375 grams of water instead of 400 grams of water for the initial mix. If you don’t have a Dutch oven or cast iron combo cooker, you could bake in a cast iron skillet, a pizza stone or a sheet pan, uncovered. You could also bake the bread in a greased 9 x 5-inch (22 x 12 cm) loaf pan (place the bread in the pan seam-side down instead of in a proofing basket.) Bake at 475°F (240°C) for 40–45 minutes, until amber brown. Reduce the oven temperature for the last 20 minutes of baking if the bread is getting too dark on top. The bread won’t look as shiny and have as crispy of a crust, but will taste just as good!",

            "Make the polenta: Grease a baking sheet with nonstick spray. In a large glass bowl, whisk together the polenta and water. Microwave on high power for 20 minutes, whisking halfway. The polenta should be thick and creamy. If not, microwave for another 2–3 minutes, stirring every 30 seconds. Add the butter, Parmesan, salt, and pepper and whisk until well combined.",
            "Transfer the polenta to the prepared baking sheet and spread in an even layer. Wrap in plastic wrap and let set in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours, or up to 3 days.",
            "Make the lemon herb yogurt sauce: In a medium bowl, whisk together the yogurt, dill, salt, garlic powder, Zesty seasoning, and lemon juice. Cover and chill in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes before serving.",
            "Make the spicy tomato sauce: In a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, heat the olive oil until shimmering. Add the onion and salt. Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook the onions for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until fragrant.",
            "Increase the heat to medium-high and add the red wine vinegar, oregano, garlic powder, basil, and red pepper flakes and stir to coat. Add the crushed tomatoes and simmer for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, to allow the flavors to meld. Remove the pot from the heat and add the lemon juice and another generous pinch of salt and stir to combine. Cover to keep the sauce warm or let cool to room temperature.",
            "Once set, carefully invert the polenta onto a cutting board. Cut off ¼ inch (6 mm) from each side, creating sharp edges. Cut crosswise into 5 pieces each measuring 3 inches (7 cm) wide, then cut each piece lengthwise into 1-inch (2 ½ cm) strips. You should have 55 pieces total.",
            "Heat the vegetable oil a large, wide pot over medium-high heat until it reaches 375ºF (190°C). Line a baking sheet with paper towels.",
            "Working in batches to avoid crowding the pan, fry the polenta sticks for 2–4 minutes, until golden brown and crispy. Remove from the oil and transfer to the prepared baking sheet to drain and cool for at least 5 minutes.",
            "To serve, form a tower by arranging 3 polenta sticks horizontally, then stacking 3 perpendicular sticks on top.",
            "Repeat with the remaining sticks. Serve with the yogurt and tomato sauces alongside.",
            "Enjoy!"

If the watermelon will not lay steadily with that side up, slice a small amount off the back to make a flat surface, which will allow the watermelon to sit evenly.",
            "On the top of the watermelon, cut 1-inch deep diagonal slits in opposite directions to form a cross-hatch pattern.",

            "Bake the watermelon for 30 minutes. You will begin to see a bit of smoke coming from the roasting pan. If it is smoking too much, you may need to carefully tighten the foil around your pan to keep the smoke inside.",
            "Reduce the oven temperature to 250°F (120°C). Continue baking the watermelon for 3 hours, then remove the foil and roast another 3 hours.",
            "While the watermelon roasts, make the chipotle and honey glaze: Heat the canola oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Once the oil is shimmering, add the garlic and ginger and cook, stirring frequently, for 1-2 minutes, or until light golden brown in color and very fragrant.",
            "Add the coconut sugar, honey, orange juice, mustard, chipotle, salt, and Worcestershire sauce and cook, stirring constantly, until the mixture is evenly combined. Bring to a simmer and then reduce the heat to medium. Cook, stirring often, for 10-12 minutes more, or until reduced by half. The glaze should coat the back of a spoon and leave a trail behind it when stirred in the pan. Transfer the glaze to a liquid measuring cup or medium bowl to cool; you should have about 1 cup.",
            "After 6 hours, remove the watermelon from the oven and turn the broiler on high.",
            "Remove the watermelon; it should look slightly charred and reduced in size. Carefully remove the rack from the roasting pan and place on a baking sheet. Discard the excess liquid and hickory chips from the pan. Return the rack with the watermelon to the roasting pan.",
            "Brush ¼ cup of the glaze over the top of the watermelon. Broil for 10-12 minutes, rotating the pan as needed, until the glaze has evenly caramelized. If one spot is getting darker more quickly than others, use foil to cover that specific area. Remove the watermelon from the oven and let cool slightly.",
            "Using long metal spatulas to support the watermelon, transfer it to a large serving platter with sliced oranges or fresh rosemary or thyme sprigs. Glaze the warm watermelon with another ¼ cup of the glaze. Slice the watermelon and serve with the remaining glaze alongside.",

            "Bake for 45–50 minutes, rotating the pan halfway, until the cake is golden brown, pulling away from the sides of the pan, and the top springs back slightly when pressed. A cake tester or toothpick inserted in the center should come out clean.",
            "Remove the cake from the oven and let cool for 5–10 minutes. The cake should still be very warm, but cool enough to handle. Remove the cake from the pan and place pan-side down on a wire rack or cutting board. Slice the domed top off the cake and discard or save for another use.",
            "Remove the ice cream bowl from freezer and peel back the top layer of plastic wrap. Gently flip the cake upside down, placing the still-warm, cut side of the cake down on top of the ice cream. It should fit snugly inside the rim of the bowl. Gently press the cake down to ensure it makes full contact with the ice cream. Cover again with plastic wrap and return to the freezer for at least 6 hours, up to overnight.",
            "Remove the ice cream bowl from freezer. Fill a slightly larger bowl about ⅓ of the way with hot water. Carefully lower the ice cream bowl into the hot water, ensuring that the water line is well below the rim of the bowl so it doesn’t spill over.",
            "Set a wire rack inside a baking sheet. Peel back the plastic wrap and carefully invert the ice cream bowl onto the center of the wire rack. Remove the bowl and plastic wrap.",
            "Using the hot water in the larger bowl, warm an offset spatula for a few seconds. Use the spatula to smooth out any creases in the ice cream left by the plastic wrap. The surface of the ice cream should be as smooth as possible. If there are any gaps between the ice cream and cake, fill in with the leftover ice cream. If the ice cream has started to melt at all, return to the freezer until completely frozen again, 1–2 hours.",
            "Make the chocolate glaze: Add the chocolate, butter, and corn syrup to a medium microwave-safe bowl. Microwave in 30-second intervals, whisking between, until completely melted. Whisk vigorously until glaze is smooth and glossy. Let cool to about 100°F (38°C), or just warm to the touch, before using.",
            "Pour the chocolate glaze directly over the top of the ice cream dome in one continuous pour, using a spatula to ensure the chocolate leaves the bowl quickly. Ensure the bombe is covered completely by swirling the chocolate in a 2-inch circle over the top center of the dome.",
            "Let the bombe sit at room temperature 5–10 minutes for the ice cream to soften slightly and the glaze to set, or place in the refrigerator for up to 30 minutes. If serving more than 30 minutes later, return to the freezer, then let the bombe thaw at room temperature for 15–20 minutes before slicing and serving.",

Whisk in the flour and cook until golden, about 1 minute. Stream in 2 cups of milk and cook, whisking constantly, until slightly thickened, about 2 minutes.",
            "Reduce the heat to medium-low and stir in the cream cheese, mozzarella, Parmesan, salt, pepper, and remaining cup of milk until fully combined. Cook for about 3 minutes, whisking constantly, until smooth. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the lemon juice. Reserve 2½ cups (600 ml) of the Alfredo sauce, then toss the cooked fettuccine in the remaining sauce until well coated. Let cool until ready to use.",
            "Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Grease a 9x5-inch (23x13 cm) loaf pan with nonstick spray.",

            "Spread about ½ cup (120 ml) of the reserved Alfredo sauce over the dough, then top with the sauced fettuccine, laying the noodles lengthwise, which will help when rolling.",
            "Starting with a long side, roll the dough into a log and pinch the seam firmly closed. Trim 1 inch (2.5 cm) off the ends. Twist the dough around itself, creating a braid-like log. Tuck the ends together so the seams are down and transfer to the prepared loaf pan. Be careful not to work the dough too much while twisting, as the dough can tear from the weight of the noodles.",
            "Cover the dough with a kitchen towel and let rise for another 20–30 minutes, or until visibly puffed. Uncover the dough and brush with the beaten egg.",

She would wait until we arrived before starting on the dish, so every time I see the batter bubble, roll up the sides, and then hear that crackle and sizzle, I get nostalgic. Almost everything is sweeter in the South—the tea, the lemonade, the desserts. But cornbread is the exception. Cornbread from the North is actually sweeter, closer to a muffin. Southern cornbread is a starch, not a sweet, and is used for soaking up all the yummy juices on the plate. This version is perfect for doing just that.",

Pat the shrimp dry between paper towels, then refrigerate until ready to fry.",
