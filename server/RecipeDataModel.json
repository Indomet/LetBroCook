Add the onion and cook, stirring frequently, until soft and beginning to caramelize, 3–4 minutes. Add the ground turkey and cook until browned, then add the garlic and sauté for another minute, until fragrant. Stir in the flour, then the tomato paste, until well-distributed. Deglaze the pan with the red wine, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Bring to a boil for 2 minutes, until the wine begins to reduce and thicken. Add the carrots, peas, and corn, stirring to combine. Then, add the thyme, sage, Bush’s® Zero Sugar Added Baked Beans, chicken broth, salt, and pepper and stir to combine. Bring to a simmer and cook for 4–5 minutes, until the sauce reduces slightly and thickens.",

I experimented with different ways of adding more pandan to the dish, but to be honest, using pandan extract was the easiest method, it yielded the creamiest outcome, AND had the best flavor.",

Add the onions and stir with a wooden spoon to coat in the melted butter, then cover the pot, reduce the heat to low, and cook for 5 minutes. Remove the lid, increase the heat to medium-low, and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are deep golden brown, 40–45 minutes.",
            "Add the rosé to the pot and cook until the wine is reduced by half, about 5 minutes. Add the balsamic vinegar and Worcestershire sauce and stir to combine.",
            "Stir in the flour until fully incorporated, then cook off the raw flour taste for about 1 minute. Add the beef stock, increase the heat to medium, and simmer for 15 minutes to help thicken the soup. Remove the soup from the heat and immediately transfer to the refrigerator to cool completely, about 1 hour.",
            "Once the soup has cooled, pour through a fine-mesh strainer into a medium bowl to separate the onions from the broth. Transfer 4 tablespoons of the onions to a small airtight container and refrigerate until ready to use, up to 3 days. The remaining onions can be saved for another use (fold into 1 cup sour cream and 1 cup Greek yogurt for a quick French onion dip, or spread on top of toast).",
            "Prep the deviled eggs: Add hard-boiled eggs to the bowl with a broth, using a weighted plate to fully submerge, if needed. Cover the bowl with a lid or plastic wrap and refrigerate for 24 hours.",
            "Line a 9 x 13-inch baking sheet with parchment paper.",
            "Remove the eggs from the broth and discard the broth, then pat the eggs dry with paper towels.",
            "Slice the eggs in half vertically with a chef's knife. Gently press the back of the egg whites to pop the yolks out into a separate medium bowl. Arrange the egg whites, divot-side up, on the prepared baking sheet and refrigerate until ready to assemble.",
            "In a blender, combine the mayonnaise, reserved 4 tablespoons of caramelized onions, the garlic powder, and salt and blend until smooth. Add the egg yolks and blend until silky smooth with no lumps. Transfer the filling to a piping bag fitted with a large, fluted tip and refrigerate until ready to assemble the eggs.",
            "Make the bread crumbs: Melt the butter in a small saucepan over low heat. Add the panko, rosemary, thyme, and salt. Cook, stirring frequently, until the panko is golden brown, 2–3 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and let the bread crumbs cool to room temperature, then set aside until ready to use.",
            "Assemble the deviled eggs: Pipe the caramelized onion-egg yolk mixture into the egg white shells until the filling rises roughly 1 inch above the white. Top each egg with ½ tablespoon of bread crumbs and a sprinkle of grated Gruyère cheese. Toast the tops of the deviled eggs with a kitchen torch until the cheese is melted and golden brown.",

The most common shape for tteokbokki are cylinders, or you can make fun shapes like hearts. Coat the rice cakes in more sesame oil and spread them out so they don’t touch and stick together, then repeat with the remaining dough. You should have about 1 pound. If not using immediately, the rice cakes can be stored in a zip-top freezer bag or wrapped tightly in plastic wrap and frozen for up to three months.",

This simple take on the Eastern European cookie skips the yeast and rising time of traditional rugelach and comes together quickly with the help of a mixer. Adding cream cheese to the dough provides both softness and tang, a perfect counterpart to the creamy chocolate filling.",

Add 1 whole egg, 3 egg yolks, and a pinch of salt to the well and slowly beat with a fork, gradually incorporating flour from around the edges. When the dough starts to come together, switch to your hands and knead until the dough is smooth and supple, 20–30 minutes. Alternatively, combine the ingredients in a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook and beat on low speed until smooth and pliable, about 15 minutes.

Dust the pasta sheet with flour and cover with plastic wrap. Repeat with the remaining portions of pasta dough.",

Make a well in the center and add the remaining egg, 3 egg yolks, and a pinch of salt. Repeat steps 2–5 to make 2 flat pasta sheets, then use the wide noodle/fettuccine setting on the pasta maker to cut the colored pasta into noodles. Dust with flour.",
            "Place a sheet of plain pasta on a floured surface, then arrange a third of the colored noodles on top in a stripe pattern. Gently press the colored noodles down with a rolling pin to adhere.",

            "Lay out the striped pasta sheets on a floured surface and use a 2½-inch square cutter to cut out squares. Set aside.",
            "Make the cacio e pepe filling: In a food processor, combine the drained ricotta, spinach, nutmeg, Parmigiano-Reggiano, and mozzarella and blend until smooth and rich. Season with salt and pepper to taste.",
            "Assemble the ravioli: Take a square of pasta dough, striped side out, and spoon 1–2 tablespoons of the filling onto the center. Wet the outside edges with water, then fold to make a triangle, gently pressing the edges down to seal. Repeat with the remaining pasta and filling.",
            "Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over medium heat. Add the ravioli and cook until they float to the surface, 60–90 seconds, then remove with a slotted spoon.",

Close the empanada maker to seal. Repeat with remaining empanada dough and filling. (If you do not have an empanada maker, line a clean surface with a  sheet of parchment paper. Place a disc of empanada dough on the parchment and moisten the edges with egg wash. Scoop a heaping spoonful of the filling onto one half of the disc. Fold the disc over the filling and press to close, using a fork carefully crimp the edges.)",

Brush the tops of the empanadas with egg wash, then cook for 7–10 minutes, flipping halfway through, until golden brown. If deep-frying the empanadas, carefully place in the hot oil a few at a time and fry until the dough has bubbled and is deep golden brown in color, about 5 minutes. Transfer to the wire rack to drain and cool slightly. If baking, arrange on the prepared baking sheet. Cut 3 small slits in the top of each empanada to vent, then brush the tops with the egg wash.

Black-eyed peas, the glue that holds these empanadas together, have been grown in the Americas since before the 1700’s and have historically been used by farmers (including George Washington) as companion crops. Over the next 100 years, black-eyed peas became significant to African-Americans, and are often associated with good fortune, so they are served on holidays like New Year’s Day in dishes like Hoppin’ John. Drawing on those traditional flavors, these soul-panadas are like a soul food meal, wrapped in a deep- or air-fried crust. They can be assembled ahead of time and frozen for a convenient snack or easy meal anytime!",

Once browned, use a flat-sided wooden spatula to break up the sausage and continue cooking until no pink remains, about 2 minutes more. Transfer the sausage and any excess oil to a plate lined with 2 layers of paper towels. Set aside.",

Once the butter melts, add the flour and, using the wooden spatula, scrape up any sausage bits stuck to the bottom of the pan. Continue to cook the roux, whisking constantly, for 2–3 minutes, until it is bubbling slightly, light golden brown, and fragrant. Slowly stream in the milk and cream, whisking constantly so no lumps form. Bring to a simmer and cook, continuing to whisk, until thickened, 5–7 minutes. Season with the salt and pepper. Transfer the gravy to a heatproof bowl and set aside.",

            "Reduce the heat to medium and add the onion. Season with salt and sauté until translucent, 5–7 minutes.",
            "Add the garlic, thyme, oregano, red pepper flakes, and fennel seeds. Sauté for 1 minute, until the garlic is fragrant.",
            "Add the tomato paste and cook, stirring frequently, until the color turns dark red, 3–4 minutes.",
            "Deglaze the pot with the red wine, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom, and cook until the liquid has almost evaporated, 1–2 minutes.",
            "Add the canned tomatoes, passata, carrot, butter, the browned meatballs, and 2 teaspoons of salt. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 1½–2 hours, until the sauce has thickened.",
            "Remove the sauce from the heat and discard the carrot, then use a potato masher to crush the meatballs into small pieces. Season the sauce with more salt to taste. If the sauce tastes too acidic, add the granulated sugar. Stir in the basil leaves and set aside.",
            "Make the béchamel sauce: Melt the butter in a large pot over medium heat. Once the butter starts to foam, add the flour. Cook, whisking constantly, for about 3 minutes, until no lumps remain but the roux has not yet browned. While whisking, slowly pour in the milk until evenly incorporated. Whisk in the salt, garlic powder, and nutmeg. Bring to a low simmer and cook, whisking often, until the sauce has thickened enough to coat the back of a spoon, 8–10 minutes. Remove the pot from the heat and stir in the Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.",
            "Assemble the lasagna: Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Grease a 9 x 13 x 3-inch baking dish with nonstick spray.",
            "Add no-boil lasagna noodles to a large baking dish or bowl. Cover with hot water and add the olive oil. Let sit for 5–10 minutes, until the noodles are a bit more pliable, but still snap when broken in half.",
            "Spread about ¾ cup of the meat sauce on the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Add a layer of lasagna noodles. Spread about 1 heaping cup of béchamel over noodles in an even layer. Top with 1 heaping cup of meat sauce, followed by ¼ cup fontina and ¼ cup grated mozzarella. Add another layer of noodles, arranging in the opposite direction as the first layer, and top with about 1 heaping cup of béchamel. Repeat to make 4 more layers, ending with a layer of lasagna noodles.",
            "Spread 1 cup of béchamel, then 1 cup of meat sauce over the noodles. Scatter the remaining ½ cup of fontina, the fresh mozzarella cheese, and grated Parmigiano-Reggiano on top. Reserve the remaining meat sauce for serving. Cover the baking dish with a sheet of foil (grease the underside with nonstick spray to prevent the cheese from sticking) and place on a rimmed baking sheet.",
            "Bake the lasagna for 30 minutes, then remove the foil and bake for another 25–30 minutes, until the cheese is melted and bubbling. Broil for 1–2 minutes, if desired, to brown the cheese. Remove from the oven and let the lasagna sit for at least 20 minutes to cool.",

            "Make the dough: In a large bowl, combine the milk and water. Add the flour, sugar, salt, yeast, malt and butter and use your hands to combine until the dough resembles a shaggy mass, then bring together into a rough ball (we do not want to develop gluten here, we just want to hydrate the flour and create a unified dough). Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a kitchen towel and allow the dough to rest at room temperature until it rises to 1½ times its original size and has a slightly puffy texture, about 1 hour depending on the temperature of your kitchen.",
            "Punch down the dough, then turn the dough from the bowl onto a large piece of plastic wrap. Gently press the dough into a rough 8-inch square. Wrap the dough tightly with the plastic wrap, then refrigerate for at least 3 hours, preferably overnight.",
            "Make the butter block: Place a 12 x 15-inch (30 x 38 cm) sheet of parchment paper on a work surface with a long side nearest to you. Slice the butter lengthwise into ¼-inch-thick (6 mm) pieces, then arrange the slices in a single layer like tiles in the center of the parchment. Fold the edges of the parchment over to encase the butter, then flip the packet over so the seam is facing down. Let the butter packet rest at room temperature until it is pliable, but not greasy, about 30 minutes depending on the temperature of your kitchen.",
            "Roll a rolling pin over the packet to distribute the butter in an even layer all the way to the edges and corners with no spaces between tiles. Place the butter packet in the refrigerator to chill until ready to use.",
            "Laminate the dough: Remove the butter block from the refrigerator and let it soften at room temperature until bendy, but still cool, 10–20 minutes depending on the temperature of your kitchen (the butter and dough should be about the same temperature and have the same texture when you hold them in your hands).",
            "Lightly dust a clean surface with flour and place the refrigerated dough on top. Lightly dust the top of the dough with flour, then roll the dough out to a rectangle about 20 inches (50 cm) by 6 inches (15 cm), roughly 1 inch (2.54 cm) wider and twice the length of the butter block. Orient the dough so a short side is nearest to you.",
            "Open the butter packet and flip the parchment over to place the butter at the bottom of the dough rectangle, with about ½ inch (1.24 cm) of dough exposed around the sides and bottom of the butter block. Gently peel back the parchment paper from the butter and discard.",
            "Fold the top half of dough over the butter, stretching gently so that the edge of the dough reaches the exposed edges beneath the butter. Use the palm of your hand to gently press the side and bottom edges of the dough together to seal the packet closed and lock in the butter. Turn the dough 90°; it should look like a closed book with the left edge the “spine” side and the right edge the “page” side. Use the rolling pin to firmly (but not aggressively) press the dough, creating indents to help spread the butter between the layers. Use a serrated knife to cut down the middle of the spine to expose the butter and release the tension from folding the dough. Turn the dough 90° again so the split spine is nearest to you. Gently begin to roll the dough away from you, stretching the dough vertically and moving the dough frequently to prevent sticking, until it is about 12 inches (30 cm) long, then continue until the dough is about ¼ inch (6 mm) thick; the dimensions of the dough should be about 24 inches (60 cm) x 12 inches (30 cm).",
            "Fold the bottom third of the dough up and the top third down, similar to folding a letter. Make sure that all of the corners of the dough meet to make a uniform block. (If the dough feels like it has become too elastic and bounces back when you try to roll it, or if the dough and butter feel like they are too warm and the butter might begin to melt and seep out from the block, cover the packet with plastic wrap and refrigerate until the dough has had time to relax and the butter has chilled slightly, 10–20 minutes.) Making sure the opening of the “letter” is nearest to you, roll the dough out again to about ¼ inch thick, 24 inches (60 cm) long, and 12 inches (30 cm) wide. Use the serrated knife or pastry wheel as needed to trim about ½ inch (1.24 cm) from the edges of the dough to create an even rectangle.",
            "Rotate the dough 90° so a long edge is nearest to you. Fold the left two-thirds of dough over to just past the center of the dough. Then, fold the right third of the dough over towards the left so the edges meet. Gently press the two ends together to make a seam that resembles an offset book spine. Fold the left side of the dough over to meet the right edge of the dough (this is called a four-fold). Cover the dough with plastic wrap and refrigerate to let the gluten relax and butter chill, 30–40 minutes.",
            "Shape the croissants: Line 2 18 x 13-inch (45 x 33 cm) baking sheets with parchment paper.",
            "Place the rested dough on a very lightly floured surface with a long edge nearest to you. Roll the dough out to about ¼ inch (6 mm) thick, 24 inches (60 cm) long, and 12 inches wide (30 cm). Use the serrated knife or pastry wheel to trim about ¼ inch (6 mm) of the dough on all sides to make a clean and straight-edged rectangle.",
            "Use a ruler to measure 3 inches (7 cm) to the right from the top left corner. Use a pastry wheel to cut from this point to the bottom left corner to create a triangle. Measure 3 inches (7 cm) to the right from the bottom left corner and cut straight up to create another triangle. Continue cutting the rest of the dough; you should have 10-12 dough triangles total.",
            "Use the pastry wheel or a paring knife to cut a ½-inch (1.24 cm) slit at the center of the base of each triangle, then tightly roll the dough up from the base to the tip, without applying too much pressure. Place the croissants on a prepared baking sheet with the tips tucked underneath, spacing evenly on the pans, 5–6 per sheet.",
            "Pour boiling water into 2 small ramekins or bowls. Place a ramekin on each sheet pan, then lightly cover the pans completely with plastic wrap (this will create a humid environment for the croissants to proof). Let the croissants proof until the dough is soft and puffed and slightly wobbles when you shake the pans, 2–3 hours.",
            "Position the oven racks to the upper and lower thirds of the oven. Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C).  Place a pan of boiling water at the bottom of the oven; this will help create steam as the croissants bake.",
            "Brush the croissants with the beaten egg, then place in the oven. Bake, swapping the pans from the top to bottom rack and rotating 180° halfway through, until the tops are a deep golden brown, about 30 minutes.",
            "Transfer the croissants to a wire rack and let cool completely before serving, about 20 minutes.",

Working with one portion of dough at a time, roll into a taut ball by cupping your hands over the dough and rolling against the counter, tucking the ends underneath. Repeat with the remaining dough.",
            "On a clean surface, use a rolling pin to roll a dough ball out to a 7-inch circle. Use a pastry brush to lightly brush the surface of the dough with the coconut oil and butter mixture, then gently fold the dough in half to make a half-circle and transfer to the prepared baking sheet.

Smooth the mounds if needed, then lightly brush the egg wash around the top half of each scoop of filling. Fold the bottom half of the dough up and over the filling, pressing around the mounds to seal and release any air (make sure none of the filling is trapped between the edges of the dough). Use a paring knife to cut between the filling mounds to separate into 3 patties, then trim the edges to about ½ inch. Transfer to a prepared baking sheet and chill in the refrigerator while you repeat with the remaining dough and filling to make 9 more patties. If desired, gather the dough scraps and repeat to make more patties.",

            "Bake the patties for 25–30 minutes, until golden brown around the edges and slightly crisp on the bottoms. Let cool for at least 10 minutes. Leftover patties can be cooled completely at room temperature, then stored in the refrigerator in an airtight container for up to 1 week.",

Mix on medium-low speed for 7–8 minutes, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed, until the dough is silky smooth.",

            "Use a small offset or silicone spatula to spread the filling evenly over half of the long side of each strip, leaving the other half of each strip uncovered. Brush the uncovered dough lightly with the egg wash. Starting from the side with the filling, roll each strip into a log and position seam-side down. Press one end of each of the logs together, then braid the logs into a single long strand. Bring the ends of the braid together to make a ring, pressing together to secure. Carefully transfer the ring to the prepared baking sheet, making sure to maintain the large opening in the center. Cover with plastic wrap and let proof in a warm place for 30-45 minutes, until the dough is pillowy to the touch.",

Remove cooked cupcakes and allow them to cool completely.",

Place the bowl over a pot of gently simmering water and whisk well for 2 minutes to fully dissolve the sugar into the mixture. Remove from the heat then start to whip the egg white mixture. Using a hand mixer (or transfer to a stand mixer with the whisk attachment) whisk the egg white mixture on high for 9 - 10 minutes, or until glossy and stiff peaks form. Transfer the whipped meringue to a piping bag fitted with your choice of shaped tip. When the cupcakes have cooled, begin piping your cupcakes. Garnish with extra shaved chocolate on top, freshly grated cinnamon, and some red or green sprinkles. Enjoy!"

Reduce the heat to medium low and mix well with a wooden spoon until the mixture has no lumps and the flour has cooked out, about 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and allow the mixture to cool for a few minutes. Then add the vanilla extract, followed by one of the eggs. Whisk vigorously to bring the mixture together to a uniform consistency, then add the second egg and repeat. Whisk until the mixture forms a homogeneous dough, then transfer to a piping bag that is fitted with a large star tip.",

Carefully pipe 8” long ropes of the churro dough into the oil, cutting with a pair of sharp kitchen shears or simply ripping by hand. Allow the churros to fry for 2-3 minutes, flipping halfway through for even golden brown colour. When golden and cooked, take the churros out of the oil, transfer to a paper towel lined plate, then transfer once more to the bowl with the cinnamon sugar. Toss the churro around to coat in the cinnamon sugar then set aside and repeat until all of the churros have been cooked.",

Top with chopped churros, followed by the macerated pineapple and it’s juices. Repeat with more cream, churro, and pineapple. Top your last layer with a final dollop of cream and a sprinkling of cinnamon to finish. Enjoy!"

Use the knife to remove the rind from around the fruit, following the contours of the fruit and cutting carefully to remove all of the pith, but leaving as much flesh intact as possible. Holding the fruit in your non-dominant hand over a liquid measuring cup, use the knife to cut between the membranes to release the segments and transfer to a separate medium bowl. Let the juice drip into the measuring cup below as you cut. Once all of the segments have been released, squeeze the remaining juice from the membranes into the bowl. Repeat with the remaining citrus. Pour ¼ cup of the citrus juice into the bowl with the zest. Reserve the rest of the juice for another use.",

Avocado adds a creamy counterpoint to the tangy sweetness of the citrus, while arugula adds a peppery bite. Feel free to use a range of fruit–grapefruit and all varieties of oranges work great, as do mandarins, tangerines, and Meyer lemons. The more variety, the prettier the salad will be!",

Cook, turning the churros frequently, until golden brown all over, 3–4 minutes. Transfer to the wire rack to drain for about 15 seconds, then toss in the cinnamon sugar until well coated.

Drain the boba and rinse with cold water to stop the cooking process. Transfer to a medium heatproof bowl.",

I was inspired by my favorite local Thai restaurant to add the fabulous flavors of curry and turmeric to classic fried rice. I used to love ordering their curry fried rice, but wanted to make a vegan version. This dish is incredibly simple and makes a delicious quick meal.",

Working in batches, cook the chicken, turning the pieces halfway through, until lightly browned on all sides, 5–6 minutes per batch. If the pot seems dry, add more olive oil as needed between batches. Remove the chicken from the pot and set aside.",

Increase the heat to medium-high and bring to a boil. Once boiling, stir in the fettuccine and cook for 7 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent the pasta from sticking to the bottom of the pot or clumping together.",
            "Add the chicken and heavy cream, stirring to combine. Add the Parmesan cheese, a couple tablespoons at a time, stirring well between each addition to ensure the cheese melts smoothly. Stir in the spinach and cook for 1–2 minutes, until wilted. Season with salt and pepper to taste. The soup will thicken slightly as it cools.",

Brush the edges of the pie dough with the egg wash. Place the remaining dough round on top of the pie and press the edges together gently to seal. Trim the edges to ¼ inch, then pinch the edges together and crimp as desired. Use a paring knife to cut vents in the top of the pie.",

            "in a large bowl, use an electric hand mixer on medium speed to cream together the butter, sugar, baking powder, salt, vanilla, and almond extract until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes.",
            "With the mixer running on medium speed, add the egg yolks, 1 at a time, beating between each addition until fully incorporated.",
            "Add a third of the flour and continue mixing until just incorporated. In a small bowl, combine the milk and rum, if using. Add half of the milk mixture to the batter and mix until nearly combined. Continue alternating additions of the flour and milk, using a rubber spatula to finish bringing the batter together.",
            "Divide the batter between the prepared baking sheets, spreading evenly all the way to the edges. Bake for 10 minutes, rotating the pans halfway through, until the cakes are pale golden brown and the edges begin to pull from the sides of the pans. Remove from the oven and let cool.",
            "Meanwhile, make the filling: Fill a large pot with 1 inch of water. Set a large heat-safe bowl over the pot, making sure the bottom is not touching the water. Add the egg whites, sugar, and salt to the bowl and whisk together until homogenous. Turn the heat to medium and continue whisking until the mixture thickens. When you lift the whisk, the mixture should fall into the bowl in ribbons that hold their shape for a moment before disappearing.",
            "Remove the bowl from the heat and place on a towel on a flat surface. With an electric hand mixer on medium-high speed, whip the egg white mixture until doubled in volume, about 5 minutes. Reduce the mixer speed to medium and, with the mixer running, add the butter, a cube at a time. As you add the last piece of butter, the mixture will look broken; don’t worry! Continue mixing until the mixture smooths out again, about 1 minute. Add the vanilla and almond extract and mix until just incorporated.",
            "Assemble the cakes: Invert a cake onto a cutting board with a piece of parchment on top and peel away the parchment from the bottom of the cake. Carefully flip the cake over so the flat side is on the bottom again. Spread the filling evenly over the cake, then invert the remaining cake on top of the filling. Peel off the parchment from the top of the cake. Transfer the cutting board with the cake to the freezer and freeze until the cake is hardened, but not completely frozen, about 1 hour.",

            "Remove the cake from the freezer. Use the Christmas tree-shaped cookie cutter to cut out 8 cakes and place on the prepared baking sheet. Discard (or snack on) the cake scraps. Chill the cakes in the refrigerator while you prepare the decorations.",

Spread the mushrooms on a baking sheet in an even layer and transfer to the oven. Cook, stirring every 15 minutes, until the mushrooms have released their moisture and are dried out, about 45 minutes total.",
            "Meanwhile, truss the tenderloin: Measure a piece of butcher’s twine 6 times the length of the tenderloin. Wrap the twine around one end of the loin and tie a knot to secure the string. Make a loop around your hand with the string and place over the loin about 1 inch down from the first knot. Continue looping the twine in 1-inch intervals until you reach the end, then tie the twine in a knot to secure (this helps the tenderloin hold its shape). Generously season the beef tenderloin with salt and black pepper.",
            "Heat the vegetable oil in a large cast iron skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Place the seasoned tenderloin in the pan and sear quickly on all sides to lock in moisture, about 1 minute per side. Do not overcook; it’s fine if the meat does not have a golden brown crust.",
            "Remove the pan from the heat and transfer the seared tenderloin to a small plate or baking sheet. Cut off the twine, then brush the tenderloin with the mustard to cover completely. Transfer to the refrigerator to cool, about 1 hour.",
            "Return the pan to medium-low heat. Add the butter, shallots, and garlic and cook until the shallots have caramelized, about 5 minutes, stirring with a wooden spoon or heat-safe spatula to prevent from burning.",
            "Deglaze the pan with the cognac, stirring to scrape up any browned bits from the bottom. Continue cooking until the alcohol has evaporated and the pan is mostly dry, about 1 minute. Add the dehydrated mushrooms and stir to incorporate. Season with salt to taste. Transfer the duxelles to a bowl and cover with plastic wrap, pressing directly against the surface. Transfer to the refrigerator to cool completely, about 45 minutes.",
            "On a large sheet of plastic wrap, arrange the prosciutto in a large rectangle wide enough to cover the tenderloin, layering evenly. Spread the mushroom mixture evenly across the prosciutto, leaving a 1-inch border around the edges, and press down in a flat layer.",
            "Place the tenderloin at the bottom of the mushroom mixture and use the plastic wrap to help roll the prosciutto and mushrooms around the tenderloin. The prosciutto should tightly and completely cover the tenderloin. Hold the ends of the plastic wrap and roll the log to help create a tight seal. Refrigerate the roll until chilled all the way through, about 1 hour.",
            "Place a sheet of puff pastry on a lightly floured surface and roll out with a lightly floured rolling pin until the pastry sheet is large enough to cover the log.",
            "Brush the top third of the puff pastry with beaten egg. Unwrap the log and place on the bottom third of the pastry, then roll up into a tight log, turning so the seal is at the bottom. Fold in the sides of the pastry and press under the log. Set the log on a large sheet of plastic wrap and roll to wrap tightly. Refrigerate again while the oven preheats.",
            "Preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.",
            "Unwrap the log and set on the prepared baking sheet. Brush the log all over with beaten egg, then use a paring knife to create a decorative pattern on the puff pastry. Alternatively, cut the second sheet of puff pastry into long strips and create a lattice over the Wellington, and/or cut out autumnal shapes and press them onto the log. Brush the log with more beaten egg.",
            "Bake the Wellington until the puff pastry is a deep golden brown, 30–40 minutes. If the pastry is getting too dark before the beef is finished cooking, cover loosely with foil and continue cooking. The internal temperature of the beef should reach 125°F (52°C) for a medium-rare finish.",

Instead of drying out bread overnight, we skipped that step and stuffed focaccia dough with all of the traditional elements of dressing. It’s got onions, apples, sausage, herbs, and even chicken stock in the dough! It's golden brown and crispy on the outside with a soft interior. So good!",

            "Sprinkle ¼ cup of the liquid over the flour mixture and use a bench scraper or your hands to incorporate until the dough begins to come together. Sprinkle in ¼ cup more liquid and continue mixing. If the dough isn’t coming together, sprinkle the dry bits with more small drops of the liquid as necessary; the dough will look shaggy. Fold the dough over itself to bring it together until all of the flour is incorporated. Discard the remaining liquid.",
            "Turn the dough onto a clean surface and use the bench scraper to divide it into 2 equal pieces. Shape each piece into a flat disc and wrap in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, but preferably overnight, before rolling out.",

            "Remove the pot from the heat, add the butter, and whisk to combine. Return the pot to the heat and pour in the cream (be careful; the mixture will bubble). Whisk well to combine, then remove the pot from the heat and set aside to cool.",
            "Make the apple filling: Peel the apples and cut in half, then remove the cores and cut the halves into quarters. Transfer to a large bowl and add the lemon juice and Angostura bitters. Toss to coat the apples.",
            "In a small bowl, mix together the sugar, arrowroot, cinnamon, allspice, and nutmeg. Sprinkle the dry ingredients over the apples and use your hands to toss until evenly coated.",
            "Assemble the pie: Dust a clean surface and a rolling pin with flour. Place a chilled disc of pie dough on the surface and lightly dust with flour. Roll out the dough, starting from the center and lightly pressing down with the rolling pin to flatten slightly. Rotate the dough 90° and repeat, pressing down so it’s evenly flattened all around, about ⅛ inch thick, then roll outward to make a circle. Continue rolling and rotating until the dough is about 2–3 inches larger in diameter than the pie dish.",
            "Drape the dough gently into the pie dish, being careful not to stretch it.",
            "Pour about ½ cup of the caramel sauce into the pie shell, then top with the apple filling, avoiding gaps. Mound the apples slightly in the middle of the pie.",
            "Roll out the remaining disc of pie dough. Using a pizza cutter or sharp knife, cut the dough into 8 strips of equal width. Assemble the lattice on top of the pie and press the edges of the top and bottom crusts together, then trim and crimp the edges as desired.",
            "Brush any exposed dough with egg wash and sprinkle with raw sugar. Freeze for 1 hour.",
            "Preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C).",
            "Place the pie on a rimmed baking sheet. Bake for 15 minutes, then reduce the oven temperature to 350°F (180°C) and continue baking for 60 minutes more, until the apples are tender and the crust is golden brown.",

Once the milk solids begin to brown and smell nutty, swirl the pan a few times to distribute the heat and prevent burning. Remove the pot from the heat and strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a large bowl. Let cool completely, but not to the point of hardening, about 40 minutes. If the brown butter does harden, microwave in 10-second intervals until just softened, but not warmed.",
